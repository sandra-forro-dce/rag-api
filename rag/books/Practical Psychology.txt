PREFACE
MANY books on elementary psychology have been
S published that there hardly seems to be an excuse for
another. However, the books that have been published fall
into two distinct classes, those designed as college text-
books and those written for the general reader. As a rule,
college textbooks in psychology are too difficult for the
general reader, who does not have the benefit of the lectures
and study which usually go along with the college text. The
popular books on psychology, on the other hand, are often
written more for the entertainment of the reader than as
accurate sources of psychological information. There seems
to be a real need for a book on psychology for beginners that
incorporates the accuracy and scientific viewpoint of the
college text and yet is written in such a way as to be thor-
oughly understandable by readers who have not the benefit
of the college classroom. This book aims to fill that need.
In writing the book the author has had in mind a particu-
lar group of readers, serious seekers after knowledge who
have not had the background of university instruction. The
popularity of University Extension lectures in psychology
has demonstrated that such a group exists. The author is
indebted to the hundreds of enthusiastic listeners who have
formed the audience for extension lectures in psychology at
the University of Toronto and throughout the Province of
Ontario. This book contains the results of his efforts in such
lectures to maintain strictly the scientific point of view in the
treatment of general psychology and, at the same time, to
make the subject both interesting and practical.

PREFACE
Psychology can have a valuable practical application to
the everyday business of living. In the selection of material
for this book, one of the main aims was to provide informa-
tion that could be applied directly by the reader to his own
life. There is no royal road to health, wealth, and happiness,
and the author does not offer any short cuts to efficiency.
However, it is believed that mental health, happiness, and
efficiency can be attained by persistent effort; and this book
should provide some clues as to how that effort may be
directed.
It is hoped that the book may open up avenues of knowl-
edge that the reader may wish to follow. To this end, a list of
books for further reading is included. A glossary of psycho-
logical terms is also included, as many of the terms in psy-
chology have a precise meaning in distinction to the often
loose meaning that they have in everyday conversation.
Each chapter is followed by an outline, which should prove
of value in reviewing and organizing the material presented
in the chapter. A set of review questions is also provided for
each chapter. These questions should serve a useful purpose
in aiding the student to test his knowledge.
This book is the United States edition of Elementary
Psychology, which was published by the Life Underwriters
Association of Canada. The author is glad to be able to
express his thanks to the secretary of that association, Mr.
L. W. Dunstall, for his interest and cooperation in the
project.

INTRODUCTION
In Part I the reader is introduced to the study of psycho-
logy and given some preliminary information about methods
of study of this and of other subjects.
Chapter I answers the questions: What is psychology?
What is the historical background of modern psychology?
What is the subject matter of psychology? What are the
methods used in psychology in the collection of information?
What are the divisions, or branches, of psychology?
Chapter II offers a set of practical suggestions for reading
and study. Planning and scheduling of time, a place con-
ducive to study, and concentrated effort are given as keys
to efficiency in study.

AN INTRODUCTION
Chapter I
TO THE STUDY OF
PSYCHOLOGY
I. WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY?
SYCHOLOGY is a science; that is, it studies actual events
PSY
in a scientific way. Unfortunately the word psychology
has been associated in the minds of many people with
all kinds of mysterious, occult studies, such as mind read-
ing, thought transference, mental telepathy, character
analysis by the stars, handwriting, or the shape of the
face or the head. Although psychology is interested in all
human activity, such methods as those mentioned above
cannot be used because they are beyond the pale of scientific
methods.
Man has always been interested in himself, and has always
attempted to find answers to questions concerning the whys
and hows of experience and conduct. He has tried to under-
stand his own impulses, feelings, strivings, and acts. Because
of mere curiosity or for more practical reasons, he has
attempted to estimate the ability and personality characteris-
tics of himself and of other people. Most people have opin-
ions, beliefs, and explanations of the motives that impel
individuals to work or not to work, to fall in love or to hate,
to buy or not to buy. They find reasons for the differences in
ability to learn quickly or slowly, to achieve success or to
fail. Psychology is interested in these same problems, but
the methods of attack on the problems by scientific psychol-
ogy are different from the ordinary methods of popular
speculation. In order to make its results of real value and
significance, psychology has been forced to adopt scientific
3


## p. 4 (#20) ###############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
methods of study that are designed to ensure some degree of
reliability, accuracy, and dependability.
Psychology, then, can be defined as the scientific study
of the activities of individuals. The subject matter is the
same as has engaged the mind of man ever since he began to
think about himself, but the methods are different. In order
to try to make clear what this definition means, let us ap-
proach our study from three points of view-first, a study of
how psychology developed and took its place as one of the
catalogue of sciences; second, a study of the methods em-
ployed by modern psychology; and finally, a study of the
subject matter of the study.
2. A HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION TO MODERN
PSYCHOLOGY
Although psychology as a science has had a comparatively
short history, the foundations of psychology are very old.
As long as there have been thinking men, there have been
attempts to understand the nature of man himself and the
meaning of his activities. This interest has had a long history,
which we will summarize in five major periods of develop-
ment. Some understanding of this development should help
us to understand and appreciate modern scientific psychology
better.
a. The early period of primitive notions.
One of the earliest ideas about the nature of man was that
a ghost dwelt in the body, making the body alive and con-
scious. At death, this ghost withdrew permanently, and
during sleep it wandered away, to return again when the
person woke up. All bodily activity was activated by this
ghost. Not people only, but also plants and animals and
even inanimate objects, such as rivers and wind and thunder,
were activated by spirits. This idea is called primitive
animism. We have not completely outgrown this idea; and
we find today many indications of this primitive notion in
modern thinking.
4


## p. 5 (#21) ###############################################

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF PSYCHOLOGY
b. The period of ancient philosophy.
Science and philosophy began when man first attempted
to understand the world in terms of what he actually ob-
served, and checked his imagination and sought to explain
nature in terms of natural events. About the seventh cen-
tury B.C., a number of wealthy Greek citizens had time and
interest for study and observation. They turned away from
politics and civil wars to search for something more perma-
nent and enduring in human life. A group of these early
philosophers, called monists, sought for an elemental sub-
- stance to explain the whole universe. Later another group of
philosophers, called pluralists, looked for not one but a num-
ber of such elements to form the basis for their explanations.
Later still the sophists turned from the broad general interest
in the universe as a whole to an interest in man himself.
Then in the fourth century B.C. the great Greek philosophers,
Plato and Aristotle, produced their systems of thought.
Aristotle collected a large mass of observations of physical
and biological facts of nature. He wrote a series of books.
covering the whole range of science and philosophy as then
known. In his catalogue of sciences, he included psychology,
which he defined as the study of the soul; and for centuries
psychology was the study of the soul of man. It included
speculations as to the origin and location of this soul, as
well as its ultimate destination.
c. The period of authority.
For the first thousand or so years A.D., there was little
advance in ideas about man, his nature, and his conduct.
Knowledge and education were based on the authority of
the church and the ancient Greek philosophers, and there
was little original thinking or careful observation. True,
there was an interest in the inner experience of man, but this
was colored by the mystical attitude of the early religious
teachers.
5


## p. 6 (#22) ###############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
d. The Renaissance and the dawn of science.
Following the long period of the so-called Dark Ages,
there was an awakening of interest in natural events. In the
fifteenth century there was an emphasis on individual man
and his rights. This has been called the period of humanism.
One phase of this development was the protestant move-
ment in the Christian church. And beginning about the
same time and extending for some centuries was the period
of great discoveries both in geography and in natural science,
and such well-known names as Columbus, Copernicus,
Galileo, Newton, Harvey, and Bacon should be mentioned.
Their discoveries opened up new worlds of study and re-
search in both physical and biological sciences.
e. The period of modern science.
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, experimental
methods demonstrated their great value in widening our
knowledge in physics, biology, physiology, and other sci-
ences. Psychology adopted the experimental methods of
these other sciences and began to take its place as a scientific
discipline. Speculation and armchair philosophizing gave
place to measuring and charting the actual activities of man
in a systematic way. In 1879, Professor W. Wundt founded in
Germany the first psychological laboratory in which experi-
ments were conducted with the behavior of man as the
subject matter. The progress of scientific psychology from
that time has been both rapid and fruitful.
Psychology is a part of the scientific attempt to under-
stand the world in which we live and ourselves and other
people as a part of that world. It is one of the biological
sciences, as it is concerned with the activities of living per-
sons. It is closely related also to the social sciences. It has
developed from speculation to exact experimentation and
observation of things as they occur. But this development
is not as yet complete, and modern psychology, although it is
6


## p. 7 (#23) ###############################################

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF PSYCHOLOGY
a science, still has some of the remnants of its early philo-
sophical foundations.
3. THE SUBJECT MATTER OF PSYCHOLOGY—WHAT PSYCHOLOGY
STUDIES
We have defined psychology as the scientific study of the
activities of individuals. The task of psychology is to discover
the general laws that explain the behavior of living organ-
isms; and the most important living organism is, of course,
man himself. All living is adjusting. The individual is con-
tinually subjected to stimulation from his environment and
is continually responding to this stimulation and by such
responses adjusting to his world. This continual adjustment.
constitutes the activity of the individual during his lifetime.
As psychologists, we are interested in everything that the
individual does and experiences; and as scientists, we must
adopt the principle that everything has a cause, and that if
we search long enough we shall be able to find the reasons for
any activity.
The ultimate aim of any science is to be able to predict
events with some degree of certainty and thus control those
events. Psychology is seeking to discover what particular
conditions produce a given type of activity, so that eventu-
ally the psychologist will be able to control and direct
human activity by controlling these conditions. For example,
if we knew the cause of the emotion of fear, we could prevent
fear by manipulating the conditions in such a way that the
adequate causes of fear would be absent.
The activity of adult man is very complex and difficult to
unravel, but much light can be obtained from a study of the
genetic development of activity in the growing child, as well
as from the less complex activity of lower animals. Psychol-
ogy therefore makes use of child and animal subjects at times
in its experiments. Our understanding of the normal indivi-
dual is increased by a study of the abnormal individual, for
he may show in somewhat exaggerated form some of the
7


## p. 8 (#24) ###############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
characteristics of the normal; so psychology studies the
abnormal as well as the normal person.
Psychology attempts to discover the source of knowledge,
beliefs, and customs, to trace the development of thinking
and reasoning, to find the kinds of environmental stimulation
that produce certain types of activity, to analyze feelings
and emotions, to understand how the crude unorganized
activity of the newborn infant becomes systematized into
useful forms of adult conduct, to trace the modification of
activity in learning, to develop methods for the measurement
of the activities and abilities of individuals, and many other
similar problems related to human nature and conduct.
4. THE METHODS OF
PSYCHOLOGY-HOW INFORMATION IS
GATHERED
It is necessary to distinguish popular psychologizing from
scientific psychology. We are all interested in human nature
and we all study it to a certain extent. Many of us do so in a
rather haphazard way, and are influenced by current
opinions and prejudices, and accept many popular miscon-
ceptions that pass as proved facts, while they are nothing
more than the product of someone's fertile imagination
circulated as the truth. Our everyday thought is full of
opinions, biases, beliefs, and ideas, which, although their
origins are lost in the dim past, we are willing to defend
vigorously. The author made a collection of some seventy
statements about human nature and activity; these he
has tried out on some hundreds of university students
and has found that the average number of errors made
by these students in marking the statements true or false
is just over twenty. Scientific psychology must be distin-
guished from the less accurate body of knowledge about
human activity which "everybody knows to be true." The
distinguishing characteristic lies in the rigid insistence on
scientific methods of gathering information. Scientific

Witnesses to an automobile accident seldom tell the same story in court.
This indicates that observations vary greatly.
method is merely the use of procedures that ensure that
observations and conclusions are reliable and accurate.
The most accurate method of gathering information
employed by the psychologists is the experimental method.
This is the basic method of all sciences. There is only one
way of obtaining information about the activities of indi-
viduals and that is to observe these activities. An experiment
is a controlled observation; and the controls are such as to
ensure the highest possible degree of accuracy.
It is not a very simple matter to ensure that observations
of human activities are complete and accurate. It is a well-
known fact that the ordinary observer is very inaccurate.
Experiments have demonstrated that, even with ordinary
precautions, the observations of a number of individuals of
the same event vary greatly. The evidence of witnesses of a:1

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
automobile accident in police court often indicate this
clearly. In demonstrating the inaccuracies of ordinary
observation to university classes, the author has staged some
little dramatic event, such as a quarrel, before the class and
then after the event tested their observation of it. They were
asked to answer some simple questions of fact, and to write
out a full account of what they saw and heard. No account
included all the essential facts; most of the accounts omitted
as much as half of the important items; and many of the
statements made were erroneous, Accurate observation is
difficult and requires as many safeguards as it is possible to
arrange.
One technique employed to increase the accuracy of
observation in psychological experiments is to train the
observers. It has been found that the accuracy of observa-
tions can be increased greatly by training. Anyone can
observe the activity of a child and come to some conclusions
regarding that activity; but if the conclusions are to be of any
practical value the observer must be so trained that he will
know what to look for, be able to concentrate his obser-
vations on the particular feature of the activity selected
for study, and be able to record and systematize the infor-
mation in such a way that the results will be intelligible and
useful as well as accurate.
The training of observers must also be such as to remove
all prejudice and bias. For example, "everybody" knows
that red-haired individuals are likely to be more hot-
tempered than others. This "knowledge," or prejudice,
makes it impossible for an individual to observe activity in
a reliable way; for, when he sees a red-headed person, he
expects him to be fiery and ready to fly into a temper at any
slight provocation, and this expectation colors all his obser-
vations of that individual, so that he either sees what he
expects to see or fails to notice that his expectations do not
come true. This is the common fallacy of neglecting the
negative case. The scientific observer must be trained to
ΙΟ

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF PSYCHOLOGY
discard all such preconceived notions and observe with‘an
open mind what actually takes place. He must be ready to
accept anything that his careful observations indicate, even
though the results may seem to be at variance with popular
ideas on the subject.
The complexity of human activity is also a source of
inaccuracy in observation. The observers of an automobile
accident are unable to notice all that takes place. If they
concentrate on one feature, another goes unnoticed. In an
experiment the conditions of the events are simplified. The
important features to be observed are isolated from other
factors. In other words, an experiment is an observation of
an event that occurs in restricted conditions. The event is
staged. Some important feature of the situation is changed
in a systematic way and the result of this change is observed,
recorded, or measured.
The accuracy of observations is often increased by the
use of mechanical devices of various kinds. Apparatus that
records the activity of the individual accurately is an aid to
reliable observation. Rather than attempt to observe directly
the movements of the eyes in reading, for instance, it is
much more satisfactory to utilize a moving-picture camera
or some other such device which, if properly used, will
produce an accurate record of the particular feature of
activity with which the experiment is concerned. The mov-
ing-picture camera has proved to be of great value in obtain-
ing an accurate record of the behavior of children in some
situations. Instruments that record the pulse, respiration,
and circulation of the blood during an emotional experience
have increased our knowledge of emotions. So, wherever it is
appropriate, instruments and recording devices are employed
to supplement human observation.
The results of any experiment cannot be accepted as
proved facts until the experiment has been repeated and the
results have been verified. And when the results of any ex-
periment have been verified by repetition, they are accepted
II


## p. 12 (#28) ##############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
as true for the particular conditions of the experiment; but
when the same general results are obtained under other
conditions and by other procedures, a general conclusion or
law can be established.
In a psychological experiment the subject may be either
the observer himself or some other person or persons. When
the observer studies his own activity, it is called introspection,
and when the subject of the observation is another person
it is an objective observation. Introspection is a very useful
method of gathering information about such activities as
thinking, feeling, and emotion; but if the results are to be of
any value, the method must be used with great care and with
every possible precaution to ensure that such factors as ex-
pectation and suggestion are not coloring the results. Ob-
jective observation is used wherever possible in place of
introspection.
It is not always possible with human subjects to conform
to the rules of the scientific experiment. It is impossible in
some cases rigidly to control the conditions under which the
observations are made, nor is this always desirable. Rigid
control of environmental conditions would interfere in some
instances with the normal activity of the individual and
thus distort the results. In some cases, it might also be
detrimental to the individual himself. We cannot interfere
too seriously, for example, with the normal development of
the child, and, in consequence, have to adopt in such in-
stances what might be considered a less accurate method of
securing information. The method used in such cases is the
genetic method. This method, like the experimental method,
is a way of observing and recording events as they take place.
The observations are made by trained observers and precau-
tions are taken to ensure accuracy of results. The main
difference between this method and the experimental method
is that the conditions are not so rigidly controlled and the
specific features to be studied are not isolated from others.
It is a method of observing human behavior in what might be

occurs. An aspect of the child's development is anticipated,
and the development is observed as carefully and accurately
as possible without interfering with that development by
changing the environmental conditions in any radical way.
For example, a child is about to start to walk or to learn to
talk, or to acquire a new brother or sister. The genetic method
could be used to gain valuable information about such impor-
tant adjustments by systematic observation and careful
recording of what actually happens.
There are also occasions when the use of either the experi-
mental or the genetic method is impossible, and only the
clinical, or case-history, method is feasible. For example, a
boy is brought to the juvenile court because he has come into
conflict with the law. His case is baffling, so the judge calls in
the psychologist for advice. The psychologist sets to work to
collect all the information he can about the past history and
the present circumstances of the boy, and then tries to decide,
from this information and his knowledge of the effect of
certain kinds of environment and stimulus conditions, just
what factors contributed to the present condition, and what
should be done to readjust the boy to life and to social cus-
toms. This is the case-history method in action. It is mainly
a method for dealing with individual cases, and not primarily
a method for gathering information in order to formulate
general principles of behavior. It is a method for practical
situations and usually so-called problem cases.
Besides being a valuable method for dealing with indivi-
dual cases, the case-history method can be used as a source
of general information if it is employed with necessary.
caution and supplemented by the control-group method.
Let us take an example. Suppose that case histories have
been collected on 500 delinquent children and we are inter-
ested in finding out some of the contributing causes of
delinquency. We can select some factor such as "broken
home" (the absence of one parent) and search the 500 case
13

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
histories and ascertain how many of the delinquents came
from such homes. Let us suppose that.we find that 20 per
cent of the delinquents came from broken homes. We would
be tempted to say then that the broken home is a factor in
juvenile delinquency. However, such a conclusion would
not be justified until we had examined a control group. The
group in this case would consist of another 500 case histories,
but this time on children similar to the first group except
that they would not be delinquents. Now, if we found that
5 per cent of the control group came from broken homes we
would be able to conclude that this factor is important in
contributing to delinquency as there is considerable differ-
ence between the two groups. In this way, the case-history
method can be used as a method of gathering important
information when supplemented with the control-group
method.
Human nature does not change radically, but our knowl-
edge of human nature is continually changing. So the psychol-
ogy of today differs from the psychology of yesterday, and
we shall probably know more tomorrow than we know today.
Common sense, or "what everybody knows," is continually
being supplemented and sometimes flatly contradicted as
the results of systematic observations and controlled experi-
ments in psychological laboratories, hospitals, schools,
factories, and other places become known. New light on the
reasons for what we do and think and feel has helped to free
us from the entanglements of prejudice and superstition.
5. BRANCHES OR DIVISIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY
There are a number of divisions of modern psychology.
In general psychology the main interest is in the activities
of the normal adult human being. Much important informa-
tion about human activity is gained from the study of the
growing child. This is genetic or child psychology. There are
many problems in which it is impossible to use human
subjects and so in some experiments animal subjects are

used. This is comparative or animal psychology. It has been
said that if we are to understand the normal individual
thoroughly we must study the abnormal. So the study of the
mentally ill, the feeble-minded, and other types of abnormal
individuals has added considerably to our knowledge of
human activity. This is abnormal psychology. And in order
to make our knowledge of the individual complete, we must
follow him into his social contacts and groupings, and thus
we have social psychology. Of course, one aim of psychology
is to apply the methods, knowledge, and results in practical
situations. Applied psychology is the attempt to put the
psychological facts and principles to work in various phases
of human endeavor. One field where psychology has had an
important application is that of education; but psychology
has also been applied to industry, in advertising, salesman-
ship, and personnel problems, to the fields of religion, law,
and medicine, as well as child training, parent education, and
mental hygiene.
Psychology is a biological science; that is, it is one of a
body of sciences that study living organisms. It is closely
related to physiology, which studies the functions of various
organs of the body. It draws on the sciences of anatomy
and neurology for basic information regarding the structure
of the body and the functioning of the nervous system.
Psychology is also intimately related to the social sciences.
It uses information from anthropology about primitive
civilizations, and from sociology about the present organiza-
tion of human beings in social groupings.

READING AND STUDY
W
E ARE supposed to be living in an efficient age. Effi-
ciency is the keynote today in business and industry.
But what about our personal habits, such as habits of reading
and study? Many, unfortunately, are not very efficient here.
There are those who have the idea that all they need to do is
to expose themselves to a book or a lecture and the information
will somehow soak in. Very often, however, such exposure is
a waste of time. The seed falls on stony ground and nothing
happens. Something more than mere exposure to knowledge
is necessary. The present chapter is designed to indicate
what this something more is.
Almost everyone complains about his memory. Of course,
he doesn't forget everything, but many important facts seem
to be forgotten just when they are needed most. Excuse is
often made for poor memories on the ground that memories
naturally grow weak after childhood. Professor E. L. Thorn-
dike, by many careful experiments on the relationship between
age and learning, has successfully refuted that myth. The
adult can learn more quickly than the child if he will set his
mind to it. Most people are either too complacent and self-
satisfied or else so downright lazy that they do not bother
much about trying to improve their learning methods. They
have enough knowledge to "get by" with, so why bother
learning more? They can remember as well as the next per-
son, so what is the use of trying to improve? Fortunately, the
idea that childhood is the only time to learn and that adult-
hood is the time to use the knowledge gathered earlier is
gradually fading away before the zeal and enthusiasm of
adult educators. No one is too old to learn, nor does anyone

know so much that he cannot learn more. It is possible to
teach old dogs new tricks, and it is possible for all of us to
improve our study, reading, and learning habits.
Yes, memory can be improved, and we can learn to be
more efficient in our reading and study. Adoption of some
of the following suggestions should greatly increase personal
efficiency in learning.
I. A TIME FOR STUDY
To be efficient, studying cannot be casual; it must be
planned. If, some evening, one could watch a number of
students starting to work, he would see most of them spend-
ing considerable time in getting started. "I guess I'll work
at this-no, maybe it would be better if I started at that
essay; but no, I guess that lab report is more urgent; or
should I go over that French for tomorrow?" So it goes for
some time, with half an hour or more wasted before he
settles down to work. What is needed? Simply a study-time

budget. This is a planned schedule of work put down on
paper and followed each day. In this way, no time is wasted
in getting started at work. The student knows each time he
goes to work what it is he has to do, so he starts to work at
once. The person who plans out his study in a systematic way
is the
person who gets things done and makes progress in his
learning, while the individual who waits for "the spirit to
move him" often waits a long time and is left behind in the
process. This principle of a planned work schedule can have
both a short-term and a long-term application. The immedi-
ate study jobs can be scheduled weekly, and a long-term
program of study and learning can be mapped out in more
general terms to cover a period of years. The main thing is
to plan your work, schedule your time, and keep to the
schedule.
2. A PLACE FOR STUDY
Many people lose out in their study because they have
developed bad study habits in terms of the place for study.
Sitting or reclining in an easy chair or on a couch with a book
in his hands and turning the pages once in a while, the
student may think he is studying and learning; but for the
most part he is only fooling himself and wasting time. The
student who is serious about wanting to learn has a definite
place for study—a place that he has prepared and kept for
that purpose particularly. It is a place where there are no
distractions no radio, no pictures of his girl friends, no
magazines, nothing to suggest anything but work. Here he
does nothing but study, and when he is in this place he always
works; so that he has built up an association between the
place and work, and it is the natural thing for him to start
immediately to work whenever he sits in his study place.
3. A STUDY ATTITUDE
Learning is an active process. It is intense effort that
educates. A planned work budget, a definite study place,
20

EFFICIENCY IN READING AND STUDY
and an active study attitude go hand in hand. Some details
of this study attitude follow.
a. Know what you want to learn.
It is, of course, almost impossible, without a great deal of
work, to remember everything that one reads in a book;
but it is possible to remember much more than we usually do.
As it is impossible and probably not desirable to learn and
remember everything, it is necessary to select deliberately
what one intends to learn and remember. There is only one
way to prevent the trivial and unimportant from destroying
the impression of the important, and this is deciding what is
worth remembering. Therefore, when you read an article
or a book, decide what you want to learn and remember of
the material.
b. Make a determined effort to learn.
When you have decided what you want to learn and
remember, the next essential is to make a determined effort
to learn it and intend to remember it. Much reading is prac-
tically useless. We let our eyes run along the lines of print,
but we fail to throw any real effort into the activity. Too
often the only time we really make an effort to exert our-
selves to remember is after we have discovered that we have
forgotten, and then it is too late. Many experiments have
demonstrated clearly that we learn and remember only when
we put forth some effort to do so. It has been shown that,
without the conscious intent to learn, individuals required.
from seven to eleven times as many repetitions of the study
material as they did when the intent to learn was present.
A little experiment well worth the trouble involved
is to select some aspect of the daily news that interests
you and about which you would like to be well informed.
Each day, take the attitude of actively intending to learn.

read with the idea
of discovering some-
thing worth learn-
ing; and, with all
your might, intend
to learn it. You will
probably be sur-
prised at the result
of putting into prac-
tice these two impor-
tant procedures
knowing what you
want to learn and
makingadetermined
effort to learn it.
Such a study atti-
tude may well be-
come habitual.
Using knowledge is an aid to remembering it. Many tests.
with college students have indicated that much of what
they hear in lectures and read in books is quickly forgotten.
Why? The main reason is that the students make no attempt
to recall what they have studied until they are in an examina-
tion room. The most common method of study is to read and
reread the material; but experiments have shown that a
much more efficient way is to read and then attempt to recall
what has been read, then reread and again attempt to recall.
Using knowledge helps to fix it in the mind. Telling someone
the facts you have been reading is an excellent way to clinch
them. So, when you have finished reading a section in a book,
don't close the book and feel that the job is done; but rather
close the book with your finger in the place and try to recite
the main points of what you have read and then check your-
22

EFFICIENCY IN READING AND STUDY
self by going back to what you have missed. Then, when you
have learned something, use it in some way.
d. Think about what you read.
Many accept as truth anything that they read in a book.
Aside from the fact that this is a dangerous procedure, it is
inefficient as far as remembering is concerned. One of the
very best ways of impressing facts in the memory is to raise
questions about them in your mind. Challenge the author in
your thoughts. Recall illustrations from your own experi-
ence and examine them to see whether they fit into what is
written. Compare one author with others. In other words,
keep an active, intelligent, questioning attitude as you read;
raise questions, create problems, and seek answers. The habit
of being curious, asking questions, and looking for answers is
invaluable.
e. Rapid reading is more efficient than slow reading.
Rapid reading usually implies greater concentration and
more effective learning than slow reading. Fast reading not
only saves time but it also increases the efficiency of the
retention of the material covered. Tests have shown that
speed of reading and degree of comprehension go hand in
hand. Nearly everyone can, by a little planned effort, in-
crease his speed of reading by 100 per cent. Verbalizing,
or saying the words either aloud or to oneself, decreases the
speed of reading enormously. So, if you have the bad habit
of saying each word as you read, you should practice reading
without doing so. Make a record of the amount read in a
given period of time each day and, when beginning to read
each day, look up this record and resolve to cover a little
more material than you did the day before. You will find
that this simple method will produce results in increasing
your reading speed, so that eventually you may be able to
read two books in the time it now takes you to read one.
23


## p. 24 (#40) ##############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
f. Clear, definite, concise ideas on any subject are infinitely
more valuable than general, hazy, or indefinite knowledge
of the subject.
The habit of thinking in concrete, definite terms can be
acquired; and the habit of searching for and finding the
salient important features of any topic is also possible of
attainment. Practice makes perfect here as elsewhere. Find a
concrete example for anything you want to understand and
remember. Practice picking out the important points in any
discussion. Notice carefully the meanings of terms used and
practice definiteness in the use of these terms.
g. Mastery of any subject means organization.
One of the simplest ways of organizing any subject is to
construct an outline summary of the main topics covered.
Examples of outlines are given at the end of each chapter in
this book, but it is much better for you to do this organizing
for yourself. When a topic has been organized in a logical
way, it is much more easily learned and remembered.
A number of other suggestions might be given, but too
many might lead to confusion. An interest in personal effi-
ciency in study should generate an experimental attitude,
so that through trial other aids to efficiency will be dis-
covered. Check your study habits against the following
summary.

THE ORIGIN AND CONTROL OF HUMAN
ACTIVITY
This section of our study deals with the "whys" of human
nature and activity. Why do we behave the way we do?
What is human nature and how does it develop?
Chapter III provides an answer to such questions as,
Which is the more important, heredity or environment?
What is the significance of long human infancy? What are
the basic processes of development? What are the important
stages in human development?
Chapter IV seeks the answer to the general question:
What are the main kinds of human motivation?
Chapter V describes the methods used by people to adjust
to the frustrations and obstacles in the way of immediate
and satisfaction of wants and desires.
easy
Chapter VI applies some of our knowledge of human
motivation to the very practical problem of influencing other
people in ways of thinking and acting.
Chapter VII is another application of facts about human
motivation to another practical problem, that of regulating
the behavior of young children in home and school and
community.
Chapter VIII outlines the affective side of human activity
-feelings, emotions, moods, and sentiments. Here there are
answers to such questions as, What happens when we are
emotionally disturbed? Where do fears come from? How
may fears be removed?
Chapter IX suggests some very practical points about
emotional control in both child and adult.

DEVELOPMENT AND
ADJUSTMENT
TH
HE complex activity of the adult human being is the
result of the kind of organism that he possesses and the
type of development that has taken place since his beginning
as a fertilized ovum. His structure is determined pretty
much by hereditary factors; and this structure determines,
in part, his activity—but only in part, for everything that
the individual experiences and everything that he does leaves
him a little different from what he was before. Living is
adjusting. The human being, sensitive to happenings in his
world, reacts to these events and, reacting, adjusts to changes
in his environment. Such adjustments have their effect on
his development, determining partly at least the direction,
extent, and
type of that development.
I. HEREDITY AND ENVIRONMENT
Two extreme views regarding the place of heredity in
development have been held. The first is that all develop-
ment and activity of the individual is determined by hered-
ity. The other view, equally extreme, is that the activities
of the individual are wholly determined by environmental
conditions. These views are equally impossible. The individ-
ual at conception is the product of the union of two cells,
one from the father and one from the mother. These cells
contain the germs of later development; but, as soon as these
cells unite, the influence of environment is felt. If certain
normal environmental conditions are absent, the develop-
ment of the new individual is impossible. Contained in the*
microscopic genes of these germ cells are the potentialities of

later development, but the development requires the influ-
ence of a normal stimulating environment. All development
depends on both heredity and environment. Some features
of this development seem to depend more directly on heredi-
tary factors than on environment. The color of the eyes, the
shape of the features, color blindness, and the degree of
general intelligence of the individual are determined largely
by heredity. However, what are called personality, character,
and temperament are more the result of environmental
influence.
Psychology neglects to a large extent the influence of
heredity, because of the small amount of definite knowledge
we have at present on the subject, but also because psycholo-

gists know what a large part the environment plays in the
subsequent development of the individual. Once the individ-
ual is born, there is nothing that can be done about his
heredity; but a great deal can be done about the kind of
environmental influences he is to be subjected to during his
lifetime. Despite the influence of heredity, almost any kind
of development is possible if the appropriate kinds of en-
vironmental stimulation are brought to bear on the develop-
ing organism. Whether the child becomes delinquent or not,

education, and experience he has during development.
However, no activity can be explained entirely in terms of
native constitution, for all the characteristics of the indi-
vidual undergo a certain amount of change and development
with experience. It is equally true that none of the charac-
teristics of the individual can be explained wholly in terms of
environmental influences, because all our reactions to the
world are to some extent the function of our native constitu-
tion. It may be said therefore, that the developing organism
is the product of both heredity and environment and that
both of these are essential to the normal growth and develop-
ment of the individual. However, for our purposes it is
possible to neglect almost entirely hereditary factors and
concentrate our attention on the development of the individ-
ual as it is modified by environmental stimuli.

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
Someone may ask, what about human instincts? Do we
not have to take them into account in this connection? The
term instinct has had many meanings. In this book we will
use the word to refer to unlearned behavior patterns. In
this sense the term is for use mainly in animal psychology.
A very good example of instinct is the nest-building
behavior of the digger wasp. The mother wasp has never
seen a nest built; she has had no training in the activity, no
practice, no opportunity for learning. Yet her behavior in
building her nest and laying her eggs is exactly similar to
that of all other female digger wasps. She cuts a little disk
out of the hard crust of the shore, digs a little well a few
inches deep; finds a particular kind of inchworm, which she
paralyzes by stinging it accurately in a nerve ganglion; and
fills her nest with either five or six of these worms, lays her
eggs, and closes up the nest. It is a fixed sequence of activi-
ties, each one serving as the stimulus for the next. Interrupt
the wasp at any stage and she is unable to go on, but must
start the process all over again. Much of the complicated
performance of the insects is of this nature, made up of
unlearned but highly complex activities.
Higher forms of animal life have fewer of these instinctive
behavior patterns; and, in the case of man, learning plays
so large a part in the development of his behavior patterns
that very few such instincts are found. This point will be
elaborated further in the next section.
2. THE ORGANIC BACKGROUND OF HUMAN ACTIVITY
A comparative study of the activity of different animal
species indicates several interesting facts that may aid us in
gaining a perspective on this baffling question of the organic
background of behavior. Some of the lower animal forms
have a very short infancy, or period of helplessness and
dependency. These same animals are dependent on ready-
made, or instinctive, forms of activity for all the important
functions of their lives; and related to this is the fact that
32


## p. 33 (#49) ##############################################

DEVELOPMENT AND ADJUSTMENT
they have a very limited ability to modify or change their
activity. When we observe animals higher in the animal
scale, we find that this condition is just reversed. The instinc-
tive forms of behavior are fewer in number, the period of
infancy is prolonged, and the ability to learn is immensely
increased. We conclude, then, that these features of life are
in some way closely related. The human infant has the
longest infancy; it is dependent on its parents for a consider-
able period of its life. The human child has very few ready-
made or inherited forms of adequate behavior; but it has a
great ability to learn, or to modify and change its activity
to conform to and take care of the many complex situations
in which it is placed. The native forms of behavior, or in-
stincts, are so few in human infants as to be almost negligible.
A few reflex activities, such as swallowing, sneezing, and
random movements of various kinds, seem to be about the
only activities that the child can perform without some
amount of learning. The possibilities for learning or acquir-
ing new forms of behavior are almost limitless.
The human child is born with a number of well-defined
organic needs or appetites, together with the ability to
acquire activities to satisfy these appetites; but instincts,
in the sense of unlearned activities, may be neglected in our
discussion for all practical purposes. What few ready-made
forms of behavior the child has are soon submerged under
the more important learned activities, acquired in the child's
adjustment to its environment.
3. DEVELOPMENT MATURATION AND LEARNING
There are two processes of development—maturation
and learning. Maturation is the development that occurs
through growth of structure and function. This growth is
determined mainly by the inherent constitution of the
organism. Of course, the individual must have an environ-

Each stage of development from birth to old age has its own problems of
adjustment.
The other type of development—learning—goes hand in
hand with maturation, and it is difficult at times to separate
the effect of the two. Learning is the development and change
that takes place when the individual practices an adjustment
to some phase of his environment. This type of development
is so important that we will study it in detail in a later
chapter.
4. A SURVEY OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
Development in terms of adjustment to an ever-changing
environment can be divided roughly into a number of stages
or periods. These stages of development are, of course,
artificial; but a scheme of development of this kind is useful
in an attempt to understand the whole process. The best
guarantee the individual can have of satisfactory adjust-
ment, in any stage of development, is that the individual has
34


## p. 35 (#51) ##############################################

DEVELOPMENT AND ADJUSTMENT
been able to adjust satisfactorily in all previous stages of
development. This is a rather important principle, which
should become clearer as we describe the various stages and
show their interdependence.
a. The prenatal stage.
The first stage of development is that which takes place
between conception and birth. In this stage, the individual
is protected from external stimulation, and thus develop-
ment is mostly a matter of maturation. There has been con-
siderable speculation about prenatal influences, and some
people believe that the unborn child can be influenced by
the mother's attendance at symphonic concerts and the
reading of serious books. Other such beliefs include the
production of birthmarks by a fright of the mother. It can
be said definitely that such types of prenatal influences have
no foundation in fact. However, anything that can be carried
in the blood stream of the mother can have an effect on the
developing but unborn child. This would include malnutri-
tion or good nutrition of the mother, the presence of toxins,
and deficiency or excess of glandular secretions.
b. The infancy stage.
When birth occurs, the individual is exposed to a whole
new set of environmental stimuli and has a number of impor-
tant adjustments to make. The human being is born com-
paratively helpless and immature. He must be cared for by
someone else, or he would die. But with birth and these new
environmental stimuli, he begins to learn; and what he
learns as an infant is important because it is the foundation
for later learning. His immaturity is the basis for his learning,
for he has few set behavior patterns. He is plastic and can modi-
fy his activity to fit into almost any kind of situation. Slowly
but surely he discovers meaning in the buzzing confusion into
which he was born. He becomes vaguely aware, for instance,
that people are important to him; for he soon discovers that
35


## p. 36 (#52) ##############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
whenever his basic needs are satisfied some other person is
present to provide him with food and make him comfortable.
At first he may cry when he is picked up, but soon he learns
to cry in order to be picked up. Between his long periods of
sleep he is learning about the world. His adjustment as an
infant is important mainly because it comes first in the
developmental sequence and is therefore the foundation on
which later adjustments are built.
c. The preschool stage.
The infancy period ends and the preschool stage begins
when the child has acquired the ability to get around in his
environment for himself-when he has learned to walk.
Now, instead, of an attractive ornament that "stays put,"
we have a child who can and does move around, and who can
thus get into trouble and quite literally get "under foot."
When the child learns to move around in his world for him-
self, there is a whole new set of adjustments he must make.
There are, he finds, things that he mustn't touch. There
are things that are hard or hot or cold. There is much to ex-
plore and much to learn. At the beginning of this period,
the child can make a few sounds, some of which may be
taken by fond parents to have meaning; while a few short
years later he will have mastered a language with hundreds
of words, which he can use to communicate his thoughts and
desires. He learns to feed himself, to wash himself, to take
care of his toilet needs, to dress and undress, and to perform
literally hundreds of other important activities. He learns to
adjust to other people, to play with other children, and to get
along with his parents and other adults. He has learned to
control his emotional expression fairly well-has discarded
temper tantrums and crying as methods of getting what he
wants. This is one of the most important periods of develop-
ment, because what the child learns or fails to learn during
this stage will greatly influence his later adjustments. The
last few decades have demonstrated the value of nursery

make the next stage that much easier.

schools for the preschool child, in which he can be helped and
guided in these important adjustments.
d. The school-age period.
When the child has reached the school age prevalent in his
district, he leaves the comparatively sheltered environment
of his home and enters a school, where another whole new
set of adjustments must be made. He finds that he is now
one of a group, that the discipline is different from that to
which he has been accustomed, that there are some things
that he just must do whether he wants to or not. This is often
a rather critical time in the development of the child, and
some children experience difficulty in adjustment. But ad-
justment in this new environment, with its own peculiar
problems, is helped when the child has been able to make
satisfactory adjustments previously. This, like the preceding
period, is one of great progress in learning, not just in terms
of the acquisition of academic knowledge and skills, but
also in social and emotional development.
e. The period of adolescence.
Many people think that adolescence is necessarily a period
of peculiar strain and stress, a period of difficult adjustment.
This is sometimes true, but it need not be so, if the previous
years are well used in adjusting to the demands made then.
Adolescence starts when the reproductive system begins to
mature and the secondary sexual characteristics begin to
appear. Now the sex appetite becomes active, and an interest
in the opposite sex becomes prominent. This, of course,
requires adjustments on the part of the individual, who is
helped in making them if during the early stages there has
been no artificial separation of the sexes. On the other hand,
he is hindered in making this adjustment if, during the pre-
school and school-age periods, he has been denied the chance
to play and associate with the opposite sex.
38


## p. 39 (#55) ##############################################

DEVELOPMENT AND ADJUSTMENT
The period of adolescence normally is characterized also
by a mild conflict, in which the individual at times wants to
be treated like an adult and at times wants the security and
protection of childhood. He is approaching the period of
responsibility, when he will have to make his own decisions
and can no longer be dependent on other people. Adolescence
ends and adulthood begins when the individual has achieved
a maturity in social and emotional as well as in intellectual
and physical characteristics. That is, he is an adult when he
is able to run his own life satisfactorily, to fit into a world of
responsibility, and to live happily and effectually with other
people.
f. Vocational adjustment.
The stage of vocational adjustment usually overlaps with
some of the previous stages, as the child may begin to think
about and study about the world of work and start to make
decisions as to where he can fit into it. This is an important
adjustment, which depends on other adjustments for its
success; for the acquisition of habits of work, the develop-
ment of attitudes toward work, and the knowledge of kinds
of work can take place early in development. This adjust-
ment is important enough to be discussed in more detail
in a later chapter.
g. Heterosexual adjustment.
Heterosexual adjustment is adjustment to the opposite
sex and especially to some particular member of it. It is an
adjustment that depends on many features of early develop-
ment, such as the type of early sex education received. It is
a phase of large adjustment to people in general, which will
be discussed in a later chapter.
h. Marital adjustment.
Following the narrowing of the interests and affections
of the individual to one person of the opposite sex, the usual
39

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
result is marriage. This is an adjustment that is far from
being simple and easy. A conservative estimate would indi-
cate that about one out of every three persons fails to make a
satisfactory adjustment here. The factors contributing to
success or failure in marriage have been brought to light by
a number of carefully conducted studies. These studies indi-
cate that features of early development, such as the type of
home training, the chances for social adjustment, the kind
of sex education, and many others play their part in making
this adjustment successful or the reverse. This is another
example of the general principle we have been emphasizing—
that successful adjustment at any stage of development
depends, at least in part, on the history of past successes and
failures.
i. Parental adjustment.
When the individual becomes a parent, there is again
a whole new set of adjustments to make. Being a good parent
is not easy. In a later chapter some suggestions are offered for
the guidance and regulation of child behavior, which should
be of assistance to a parent in making these adjustments.
j. The period of middle age.
The period of middle age is traditionally one of conserva-
tism. The individual has met and experienced most of the
dramatic events of an ordinary normal life and has little
that is new or different to look forward to. He must learn to
adjust to this situation. That this adjustment is not easy is
indicated by the large number of middle-aged people who
have nervous breakdowns and other forms of mental illness.
k. The period of old age.
This is the period of gradual decline in ability and activity
of the individual. He usually has to adjust to a restricted
kind of activity, often stop working, and in many ways.
reorder his life.

periods of development in terms of adjustment. We have
shown how each stage of development is dependent on the
preceding stage. We have indicated that each adjustment of
the individual has a double importance it is important both
for the present occasion and also because it helps to deter-
mine later adjustments. We would not, however, like to give
the impression that a person is of necessity doomed to failure
in adjustment because of previous failures, as it is possible
through practice and reeducation to break away from one's
past and make new and successful adjustments in spite of
past failures. This, however, requires great effort and deter-
mination on the part of the individual.

Chapter IV
HUMAN MOTIVATION
TH
I. INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT
HERE is a reason for everything we do. All human
activity has some cause. It is often difficult to find this
cause or to decide just which of the thousands of possible
influences determined any particular action. Our knowledge
of human activity will have to advance considerably before
the ultimate aim of psychology is attained, namely, to be
able to predict what particular response will follow a particu-
lar stimulus. At present we can do this only in very general
terms. To be able to predict what success an individual will
achieve in life or in any occupation, we need to know some-
thing about his abilities, his past experience, and his motiva-
tion. To be able to predict what a person will do in any
given situation, we need to know something about his
established habits, his organic condition, and what he
happens to be doing at that time. Before we attempt to
answer this very complicated question about the prediction
of particular responses, it is necessary to know something
about the kinds of influences that affect and direct human
activity. We will attack first the more general question as to
what directing influences help to determine the individual's
activity.
In general, everybody does what he does at any particular
moment because he wants to. The martyr goes to the burn-
ing stake because he desires to do just that, rather than
anything else that would relieve him from such action. The
problem in motivation is twofold: (1) to outline the kinds of
influences that direct activity and (2) to try to determine
which of these influences is active in a given situation. This
43

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
is not easy. All casual relations in human activity are rather
obscure, and it is hardly ever possible to carry our search to
an ultimate conclusion in particular cases; but it is possible
to outline some of the more basic reasons for human conduct.
Human beings have very few ready-made forms of
behavior, few instincts or unlearned activities. Rather, we
find that almost all human activities undergo modification
or change during the lifetime of the individual. All human
activity is subject to learning. This learning itself has a cause
or is motivated by something. Man has a large number of
needs or requirements that initiate behavior, so our first
task in this chapter will be to outline these basic needs or
organic requirements.
2. THE ORGANIC NEEDS OR APPETITES
Man is so constructed that he requires certain things in
order that he may keep living. He is also so constituted that
these needs make themselves felt in such a way as to initiate
activity that will eventually satisfy them. He needs air to
breathe, food to eat, liquid to drink, rest from activity,
sleep, a changing environment, the elimination of waste prod-
ucts, and sexual expression. These are all basic organic needs,
which demand periodic or continual satisfaction. They are
motives or directing influences, because they initiate and
sustain activity and also direct that activity until the
activity finally ends in a satisfaction of the felt need. We
will call these appetites.
It is characteristic of all appetites that they produce
activity. A hungry person is a restless one and this restless-
ness is directed usually toward the removal of the organic
state involved. Not only is an appetite productive of activity,
but it produces the kind of activity that habitually results in
the satisfaction of the appetite. Appetites are cyclic or
rhythmic in their action. They demand satisfaction; then,
when this is achieved, they lapse into quiescence for a time,
only to return, after a period, to the active state again. An
44


## p. 45 (#61) ##############################################

unsatisfied appetite is usually an unpleasant condition, and
as the satisfaction is delayed it becomes more and more
unpleasant and productive of further activity.
a. The appetite of hunger.
The need for food is so obvious and everyday an occurrence
that not much need be said about it. The basis of this appe-
tite is found in the organic sensations arising from an
emptied stomach. The ramifications of this appetite into all
phases of life are very extensive. All other activities must
give way to the satisfaction of this basic need. Man will go

to great lengths in his behavior to satisfy his hunger. Even
here, habit or custom plays its part; we eat three or four
meals a day from habit rather than from need. The cycles of
hunger in the young infant, occurring every three or four
hours, are modified to fit in with the routine of the household;
and, just as soon as possible, night feeding is done away with.
Before long, the child's appetite is made to conform with the
daily routine of the household. The appetite of hunger may
be more intelligently selective than we often give it credit
for being. Animals have demonstrated in experiments that,
when they are given a free choice, they are capable of choos-
ing the kinds of food that are best suited for their require-
ments. Even human children, when they are not hampered
by social conventions, usage, and suggestion, have shown
that their unmodified appetites are equal to the task of
selecting the food that is most suitable for their growth and
45


## p. 46 (#62) ##############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
development, and even of selecting the kinds of food that are
effective in remedying a condition of active rickets. Very
early in life, we begin acquiring likes and dislikes for certain
kinds of foods, often because of social suggestion, so`that the
appetite of hunger loses its trustworthiness as a selector of
what is best for us.
A great part of the life of man is spent in activity that is
primarily motivated by the need for food. Civilization, social
custom, and the habits acquired during a lifetime obscure
this fact. One of the surest and most dependable forms of
human motivation is the basic appetite of hunger. Habit and
experience complicate the picture considerably, so that man's
appetite must be satisfied in a particular way and with
particular foods; but the strength of the appetite as a form
of motivation remains unchanged. One complication is the
presence of imagination of future needs. Man's activity is
motivated not only by the present need of food to satisfy
hunger, but also by needs of the future. One of the most
important foundations of happiness, contentment, and
mental health is a feeling of security in terms of the basic
organic needs. When this security is threatened, man is
motivated in many ways. He may work harder, he may
become a radical in thought, he may try to lay the blame on
others, or he may do any one of a great number of things,
depending on his training and experience.
b. The appetite of thirst.
Thirst is another organic need that motivates activity.
The stimulus for this activity is a definite need for moisture,
which is indicated most acutely by sensations from the throat
region. In its influence and functioning, thirst is very much
like hunger. These basic appetites are most apparent when
they are denied satisfaction. In such situations individuals
are likely to go to almost any length to achieve the satisfac-
tion of their basic appetites; and the customs and habits of a
lifetime may be discarded if these interfere with this result.
46


## p. 47 (#63) ##############################################

HUMAN MOTIVATION
c. The appetite of sex.
The sex appetite is so important in life that Freud and
other psychoanalysts have considered it the one and only
important human motive. Most psychologists are of the
opinion that this is an exaggeration. Hunger, thirst, and
other appetites still to be mentioned are equally insistent.
and probably equally important as motives. Sex is not all of
life, by any means; nor is it all of the marital relationship.
The delay and thwarting of the sex appetite by economic and
social taboos have forced this appetite to find other outlets
in behavior. The secrecy, shame, and suggestions of in-
decency connected with the sex activity provide the soil for
perversions of habits and thoughts that originate from an
entirely natural and decent, but persistent, appetite. Better
management and understanding of the sex appetite is
required, as this appetite is in itself no more shameful or
indecent and probably no more powerful than any of the
other appetites.
As is true of the appetite of hunger, the appetite of sex
is overlaid by many social customs and habits. Whether the
sex appetite finds its outlet in companionship with the
opposite sex, in reading, in the enjoyment of art, or the pro-
duction of art or literature, the strength of the appetite as a
director of behavior is undeniable. Planning for the future
complicates the situation, so that the direct satisfaction of
the appetite may be subordinated to indirect forms of
satisfaction. In modern society, the sex appetite motivates
a man to save his money so that he may finally find the
satisfaction demanded in a way that is socially acceptable.
d. The appetite for rest and sleep.
Continuous activity without intervals of rest would result
in death. The appetite for rest and sleep is, then, a protective
function. Rest after activity is not only necessary but satisfy-
ing. Sleep is a condition brought about by the reduction of
stimuli or by neglecting to respond to stimuli.
47


## p. 48 (#64) ##############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
e. The appetite for change or variety.
Just as there is an appetite for rest and sleep, so there is
also an appetite for activity, for change, for different
stimuli. Watch a four-year-old. He hasn't learned to deny
this appetite as he will later. He seems unable to attend to
⚫anything for any length of time. True, the forms of play
are acquired, but they are acquired because of this basic
need for activity, for change. Work also is an activity, but
work is different from play. Play is activity for the sake of
the activity itself, while work is activity for the sake of some-
thing else. Margaret makes mud pies while mother makes
apple pies. Mother makes pies so that the family may eat.
Margie may leave her mud pies half made if some more
interesting activity presents itself, but mother must keep
on at her pie making until the pies are ready to eat. The
consequences of her activity make no difference to Margaret,
but the result of the pie making is very much the concern of
Margie's mother.
Play is spontaneous, but so is all activity until it is ham-
pered and restricted by social custom and habit. This appe-
tite for change and activity might be called curiosity—the
desire to discover, to participate; and play is often the play
of imagination. The stern realities of life and living soon put
a damper on curiosity and imagination. But play is not by
any means useless. Through play, the child learns, he finds
out things, he makes discoveries, he tries himself out.
Even when the child grows up and has to conform to the
stern dictates of social conventions, the workings of this
appetite are still apparent. Work may be play. Two men
will do more work together than they would separately.
Factory girls will accomplish more to the accompaniment
of the music of a phonograph than they would without it.
Life hates monotony. Modern industry, with its super-
efficiency and specialization, denies the satisfaction of this
basic appetite, breeds discontent and boredom, and makes of
the daily activity of millions work indeed. The appetite for
48


## p. 49 (#65) ##############################################

HUMAN MOTIVATION
change and play cannot be denied. The feverish search for
pleasure and recreation of the present day is man's reaction
to the drudgery of uninteresting work; but man's training
has been mostly a preparation for work and so he often fails
to find the required satisfaction in play.
A great part of the dissatisfaction and vague general
unrest may be traced to the inability of individuals to find a
satisfaction for the basic need for change. When an appetite is
denied satisfaction in the usual or natural way, that satisfac-
tion is sought in some indirect way. Man will go to almost
any length to find an outlet for his need for interesting and
pleasurable activity. Mental instability and even insanity
seem to be increasing at an alarming rate. This may be due
to the unsatisfied desire for activity that is not monotonous
and uninteresting. Try the experiment of engaging in some
very dull and uninteresting and meaningless activity, such
as adding two and two over and over again for some time,
and see how long you can endure it. Man requires variety in
activity.
f. Other appetites.
There are other basic needs, which we will content our-
selves with just mentioning. These appetites also demand
satisfaction and produce activity and direct that activity
in specific directions. The elimination of waste products from
the body, the appetite for air to breathe, the need of an inter-
mediate temperature producing the urge to secure warmth,
when cold, and to secure coolness, when overheated-these
are persistent needs.
Men in general rarely understand the forces that determine
their conduct. These basic needs or appetites are the basis
of a great part of the activities of the individual. The feeling
of security, which is the foundation of a mentally healthy
individual, comes when he anticipates no obstacles in the
way of achieving a regular satisfaction of these appetites.
49


## p. 50 (#66) ##############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
Some writers assume that the main goal of human conduct
is the attainment of a condition of organic comfort and the
avoidance of organic distress. Whether this extreme position
is justified or not, it is certainly true that these organic needs
dictate much of what we do and direct most of our activities.
Innumerable habits are formed because of these insistent
organic needs; in fact, these appetites are at the foundation
of most of the learning activity of the individual.
3. EMOTIONS AS MOTIVES
Another kind of motive is that of the emotions. In a later
chapter, we will discuss in some detail the emotions, so it is
necessary at this time merely to indicate how emotional
experiences direct activity. When he is under the influence
of a fear, a person may do many things that he would not do
normally. That fear motivated human behavior has long
been recognized. Parents have used fear to direct the con-
duct of their children. The state, the church, and other
organizations have from time to time used fear to produce a
desired form of behavior. Anger motivates individuals to
fight, to attack, and to say things that would be beneath
their dignity if they were not dominated by this emotion.
Besides the intense emotions of fear and anger, the milder
forms of emotion-sentiments and moods-dictate the
course of action to be followed by the individual.
4. FEELINGS AND ATTITUDES AS MOTIVES
Every experience that the individual has and every
activity in which he engages is evaluated by him as being
pleasant or unpleasant. That is, there is a feeling tone scale
ranging from extreme pleasantness to extreme unpleasant-
ness, and every experience can be located somewhere on this
scale. When an experience is evaluated as pleasant, the
individual has an attitude of approach to that experience;
that is, he tends to prolong and continue the activity. When,

The strong desire to excel, succeed, or win out over others is probably
trained into us by custom or education. It is a universal tendency.
however, he evaluates the experience as unpleasant, he has
an attitude of withdrawal; that is, he tends to discontinue
that experience. So the ever-present feeling tones of pleasant-
ness or unpleasantness, with their accompanying attitudes
of approach and withdrawal, are important human motives.
5. THE SOCIAL MOTIVES
The whole story of human motivation is not told in terms
of organic needs, emotions, and feelings. If, for instance, the
only motives of human conduct were the organic needs,
we would be able to satisfy hunger and the other appetites
in a much more simple manner than we do at present.
The whole picture is complicated by the fact that man
51


## p. 52 (#68) ##############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
is predominantly a social being. This social existence has
produced in man certain characteristic attitudes or tenden-
cies. Whether it is due to inborn nature, or, as is more likely,
trained into us by social custom and education, there is a
universal tendency to strive to excel and succeed, to win out
ahead of others, or to overcome obstruction or difficulty.
This tendency, which we will name self-assertion, can be
traced through a great many activities of the individual.
Obstruction is met with increased activity, difficulties call
for more energy, projects must be carried through to a
successful completion, rivals must be beaten, or success
must be achieved for its own sake. The so-called fighting
instinct is still another phase of this same tendency. Success
has become a human goal; and, if it cannot be attained in one
way, it must be in another.
Strange as it may sound, there is also the tendency present
in human beings to submit, to give in, to subordinate them-
selves to other authorities. This tendency we will call
self-submission, or self-negation. Forced submission to others,
which is common enough but hardly pleasant, is not what
we mean by self-submission. There is a submission that is
satisfying. There are situations that are obviously beyond
our own powers to cope with, and in these situations sub-
mission to some person, or to some idea, or to some system
of religion or to the laws of society seems to be the natural
and satisfying course. The child is submissive to the adult;
the adult is submissive to the wiser or more influential person
or to groups of individuals or to the representatives of con-
stituted authority. Admiration, hero worship, reverence,
and awe are all indications of willing and satisfying submis-
sion. Submission to a protective authority or a power greater
than ourselves may be conducive to a feeling of security
and permanence. We like to have a boss, as well as to boss
others.
A standard of mental health is a proper balance between
these self-tendencies. There are occasions when self-assertion
52


## p. 53 (#69) ##############################################

HUMAN MOTIVATION
is called for, and there are also situations when the individ-
ual's interests are best served by submission. Social inter-
course is possible only on the basis of give-and-take, of
assertion and submission. So, the socially well-adjusted
individual is the one who at times is assertive and at other
times is submissive.
Another rather powerful kind of social motivation is found
in our ideas of what other people think of us. If not in all
people, at least in most, there is a strong desire to be well
thought of, to achieve social approval. The almost universal
attempt to "keep up with the Joneses" is one very common
phase of this desire for social approval. Sometimes this desire
works in a very direct way, but more often its machinations
are indirect and perhaps obscure even to the person con-
cerned. The child seeks approval by his showing off before
strangers and family. "Watch me" is the characteristic
phrase of children in one stage of their development. The
young man strives to appear strong, skillful, clever, smart,
grown-up, sophisticated, or bad, depending on the group to
which he belongs. The almost universal attempt to improve
on nature by all kinds of beauty tricks is one of the most
common manifestations of the desire for social approval in
the young lady. The adult also strives to attain some degrees
of social approval by personal appearance, clothes, house,
car, amount of life insurance, social connections, wealth,
success in business, politics, athletics, philanthropy; or by
wit, generosity, or even assumed peculiarities and eccen-
tricities. If it is not possible to attain satisfaction for this
desire for social approval in one way, then some other
means may be adopted. Although this desire to be well
thought of is really one manifestation of self-assertion,
it is so prominent in human activity that it merits separate
mention.
Just as we go to great lengths to attain satisfaction for the
desire for social approval, so we will do almost anything to
avoid social disapproval. Social ostracism is the powerful
53

weapon society wields to regiment its members, for very few
people can stand against the disapproval of others.
Everyone desires to feel that he is secure socially. He
wants to feel that he "belongs," that he is liked, accepted,
and "at home" in his world. He strives for status, a "place
in the sun.” He learned early in his development that other
people are important to him; and, whether he will admit it
or not, this idea continues with him all his life. It dictates
and directs a great part of his activity. If his social security
is threatened, he will go to great lengths to build it up again.
His mental health depends on this feeling of "belonging" in
his world. So, the social motives are very powerful in direct-
ing human activity.
6. OTHER HUMAN MOTIVES
Our account of human motivation is not complete, and
cannot be, until we learn more about human activity than
we have been able to up to this time. There is still much to
be discovered. There is, however, one general feature of
activity that we should mention here. Once an activity is
started, there is a tendency for that activity to go on to com-
pletion. Experiments with children have shown that to break
off an activity before it is completed is to produce a slight
strain that directs the individual's behavior in such a way
that he will have a tendency to return to that activity and
finish it as soon as opportunity allows. An activity in prog-
ress, then, seems to carry sufficient motivation within itself
to carry it to some kind of completion.
Habits may also be motives. That is, once a habit has been
established, it becomes almost automatic and requires only a
stimulus to set it in action. Every individual has habitual
modes of reaction, of thought, and of belief. These ways of
thinking and acting are, of course, the lines of least resist-
ance, and therefore are the ways in which the individual
usually responds to any situation. It usually takes some
rather unusual situation or some rather strong motivating
54

HUMAN MOTIVATION
factor to divert the individual's action from these habitual
channels.
In any account of human motivation, the appetites or
organic needs are basic but not the whole story, because
man is predominantly a social being and is forced to live
in a social environment; and his behavior has to fit into the
patterns of activity that society dictates. The striving for
self-assertion and the desire to be well thought of direct
behavior, but again the direction of the activity is deter-
mined partly also by the customs of the group.
The emotions are powerful influences on the course of
behavior, but emotional expression is modified by social
pressure.
Fixed ideas, opinions, beliefs, and habits of thought
must also be considered in any attempt to account for the
varieties of human conduct.
Besides all these, there is also the great complexity of
stimuli in any situation. These stimuli are always changing,
thus changing the situation and the individual's response to
it. We act differently in different situations, the same stimu-
lus producing different responses, depending on whether we
are in church or at the club or at school or at home or in
someone else's home. Thus, the objective environment
produces a "set," or readiness to respond in a particular
way. It is
It is very difficult to predict what an individual will
do in any given situation.
Perhaps the conditions that determine an individual's re-
sponse are so complex and elusive that we shall be unable to
tell exactly what a person will do at any given time; but the
more we know about the individual and his past habits and
about the stimuli that are present, the more accurate will
our predictions become. However, the situation is not by
any means hopeless, because we do know something about
the dependable motives, appetites, emotions, and social
forces, and we can be fairly sure that the individual will act
in such a way as to satisfy these basic needs. If our task is to
55

influence some other person, we can be reasonably sure that
an appeal to these basic needs will meet with some amount
of success.

Chapter V
MECHANISMS OF
ADJUSTMENT TO
FRUSTRATION
T
1. INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT
HE account of human motivation given in the preced-
ing chapter would not be complete if we did not include
a discussion of the indirect ways in which urges and impulses
and appetites may find expression and satisfaction. Indi-
viduals are active primarily as a means of satisfying these
cravings and wants; and these motives call forth persistent
activity until some degree of satisfaction is attained. A need
unsatisfied is unpleasant, while a need satisfied is productive
of pleasure. Activity is, in general, aroused by conditions that
persist until some adjustment is made that relieves or removes
the motivating tensions. Each specific motive has a life
history. It started somewhere and somehow and persists until
the individual makes some kind of adequate adjustment to it.
Because of the predominantly social environment in which
we live, there are always situations arising in which our
wants, desires, urges, and impulses have to be denied the
satisfaction that they normally crave. To put this differently,
adjustment to a motivating situation is not always possible
in a direct way, but must take place indirectly. The demands
of one person's life frequently lead to the hampering of the
demands and satisfactions of other people.
Our natural tendencies are continually running counter
to the customs and traditions of the society to which we
belong. Conflict between our urges and the possibility of
their satisfaction is then a daily occurrence in our lives. What
happens when there is such a conflict? Do our appetites just
vanish when they are denied their normal satisfaction?
It is characteristic of motives that they must have some form
58


## p. 59 (#75) ##############################################

MECHANISMS OF ADJUSTMENT TO FRUSTRATION
of expression in activity. In other words, a motive is a
condition to which the individual must adjust himself.
Whether this adjustment is the usual one or not depends
upon circumstances. Indirect adjustment to motivating
situations is then very important, for much of the indi-
vidual's adjustment to life is of this nature. If this adjust-
ment to conflict, difficulties, and obstacles is a happy one,
so much the better for the individual and society in general;
but, if the reverse is true, both the individual and society
must suffer in consequence.
Most of the adjustments we make to life and to the ever-
present motivating situations are learned. We build up
habits of adjusting, habits of achieving satisfaction and
pleasure. These habits of adjusting to difficulties may be
general rather than specific to definite situations. The
individual may have a characteristic way of adjusting to all
difficulty, by giving in to defeat or by rationalization or by
any one of a large number of other possible adjustment
habits. Our happiness and peace of mind, as well as our
success in social and vocational situations, depend to a con-
siderable extent on these habits of adjustment.
There are two main kinds of adjustment to difficulty,
which we will call overt and covert. The overt form of adjust-
ment is more primitive. It takes the form of attack and com-
bat. When the young child's toy will not work, the child may
adjust to this difficulty by ruthless attack on the thing that
is thwarting his pleasure and destroy the toy. Overt or
immediate adjustment of this kind is rarely thought out, and
is often irrational, impulsive, destructive, and socially
unacceptable. One nation is thwarted by another; the result
is war. One individual finds another in the path to success,
with the result that he knocks him down to get him out of
the way.
The covert or inner adjustment is much more common
in our modern civilization and is much more interesting,
especially to the psychologist. Here the battle is waged within

the individual; and, as the conflict is within, the adjustment
is usually made in some indirect way. A hungry man stands
before the bakery window. Shall he smash the window and
snatch the bread, or shall he try something else? The battle
rages between the appetite of hunger and the fear of social
disapproval in the form of punishment and disgrace. If the
adjustment were immediate-if the man broke the window,
snatched the bread, and ran—there would be no conflict; but
when he weighs one motive with another, there is a conflict.
Such a conflict is usually resolved by a compromise; that is,
both conflicting motives influence the behavior. The out-
come of the conflict is usually some indirect means of achiev-
ing satisfaction without running counter to other motives.
In the example above, the battle is won for the appetite

MECHANISMS OF ADJUSTMENT TO FRUSTRATION
of hunger, but the fear of punishment leads the hungry man
to find some other means of satisfying hunger than the direct
means of taking the food.
A motive is most persistent when it is interfered with,
obstructed, or thwarted. Dam up a stream of water, and a
source of power is created that will break through some-
where. Interfere with a motive, and the tension is increased,
the motive increases in power and insistence, and like the
water it will break through somewhere. Conflicts must be
adjusted; or, to state this otherwise, the individual must
adjust in some way to difficulties and obstacles in the path
of his active motives. This adjustment may be nothing
more than a conscious giving up, but it must be some form
of adjustment that is for the time being the best solution
of the difficulty that the individual thinks he can make.
Interference with motives may come from a number of
sources. There may be antagonistic urges; that is, one
fundamental trend may conflict with another or others,
and all cannot be gratified. A motive may collide with the
established habits, ideals, or conventions of the individual,
or with the laws, taboos, of the society in which he lives.
The mere fact that we find it necessary to have laws indi-
cates the potency of these human motives, which, it seems,
must be kept in check somehow. Another source of inter-
ference is natural obstacles or unchangeable realities.
Famines, wars, business depressions, death of parents, and
so on, may thwart many urges and prevent their normal
satisfaction.
What happens when this thwarting occurs? Put a hungry
cat in a puzzle box, with food within sight outside the cage,
and what does the cat do? He tries all kinds of activity until
he is successful in finding a way out of the box. Place a
motivated human individual in a situation where it is
impossible for him to achieve immediate satisfaction, and
what does he do? He follows the example of the cat. He
tries a number of activities until he discovers an adjustment
61


## p. 62 (#78) ##############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
that is successful in removing the motivating tensions. Ad-
justments are learned. Put the cat in the box a number of
times, and he will eventually learn to get out immediately.
Make it necessary for an individual to adjust to difficulties a
number of times, and he acquires a habit of meeting such
situations, even if the habit is merely that of giving up and
saying that the effort isn't worth while.
There are great individual differences in the ability to
withstand the thwarting of active motives. At one end of
the scale there is the stolid individual who maintains his
poise through everything; nothing seems to upset him. At
the other extreme is the individual who is very easily upset;
the slightest setback and he is neurotic, greatly disturbed,
has a temper tantrum, or a fit of "nerves," or becomes sulky.
What makes the difference? It is pretty much a matter of
experience.
The child of two, when he is faced with a situation that
thwarts his desires, may fly into a fit of anger and have a
temper tantrum. The worried parents fly to his aid, and
he can have anything in the house as long as he will stop
this terrifying behavior. What will he do next time? Why,
repeat the kind of performance that worked this time, of
course. The same thing may go on until the parents in disgust
stop being worried and let the temper tantrum go unre-
warded, or perhaps the schoolteacher will have the task of
dealing with it. If this form of behavior has been successful
enough times, it may persist even into adulthood and the
person may go on having tantrums when things go wrong.
Let us suppose that the parents knew about temper tan-
trums and were not worried, even when the child held his
breath or screamed, and let the tantrum die a natural death,
what would the child do then? Well, having learned that
this method of adjustment wouldn't work, he would try
something else, and eventually find some way that would
work, at least in the home situation. Perhaps he will have to
discover another method for school and still another for the

difficulties and obstacles. We will list here the more common
ones.

We may adjust ourselves to frustration by complete surrender or
by admitting defeat; we may attack it directly by an emotional
explosion of anger; we may use one of the mental "foolers "-
introversion, rationalization, escape methods, or compensation. But
if we try to make the most of our frustration, we will find a new
outlet by sublimation—often the best adjustment to a blocked
motive.
a. Surrender.
He may give up, submit to defeat, admit failure. This form
of adjustment cannot be a permanent adjustment to any
situation. It does not dispose of the conditions that produced
the necessity of adjustment; but it may become a habit
the habit of failure. Nothing is so conducive to failure as
continual failure. Failure produces an attitude of "what's
the use?" that kills chances for success. Continual failure
begets further failure. It produces the expectation of failure
because of imagined inability to succeed in anything. This
is what is commonly called an inferiority complex. The
individual shrinks from trying because he expects to fail and
hates to have anyone find out that he isn't as good as others.
63


## p. 64 (#80) ##############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
This attitude may be built up in the growing child through
tasks that are beyond the existing stage of his development,
and not through any deficiency in intelligence or ability.
This form of adjustment, which is, of course, inadequate
and unconstructive, may be very detrimental to normal
development.
b. Direct attack.
The overt form of adjustment is that of giving battle to the
difficulty. When this method of approach is kept within
the bounds of common sense, it is the most wholesome form
of adjustment. The danger is that the direct attack may be
irrational, not thought out, ruthless, and too severe. Direct
attack may be in terms either of an anger adjustment or of
an intelligent, rational attack on the difficulty. Anger as an
adjustment to difficulty, while common enough, is rarely
adequate or efficient, as it always represents a certain loss of
control. Direct attack on problems may also be made with
intelligence and insight and, in this case, it is the most
healthy as well as the most useful form of adjustment.
c. Introversion.
Perhaps the most common form of adjustment to diffi-
culties is introversion-turning inward-a purely mental
adjustment. This is really a partial surrender, the giving
up of the outward struggle, while carrying the battle to a
new arena within the thought and imagination. When real
satisfaction is difficult, imaginary success may be substituted.
One form of introversion may be called the conquering-hero
mechanism. Much of the daydreaming of both children and
adults is of this nature. The child is denied toys, candy, or
playmates, but finds these desires satisfied in his "castles in
Spain." Adults in daydreams succeed in achieving the
desired wealth, social position, or power that they have been
unable to win for themselves in real life. The satisfaction is
just as real to the individual, but not so permanent. What

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
to believe in them, it is time to discard them for some better
method of adjustment to life's failures.
Another form of introversion, called the suffering-hero
mechanism, may be illustrated by the following story. The
small boy has been punished, perhaps unjustly (most
punishments are unjust). He would like to run away, but
he hasn't the courage to leave the security of his home for the
unknown dangers of the cold world. There is nothing to stop
him imagining that he has run away, has had an accident, and
is badly hurt or perhaps killed. In vivid pictures he paints
for himself the remorse of the parents or the teacher. He sees
them weeping when they hear of his death. Is there a person
anywhere who hasn't said, at some time or other, “You'll be
sorry, some day"? This is all trivial and meaningless, you
say? Nevertheless, the boy in our story has achieved an
adjustment to this thwarting situation-an adjustment that
is not particularly healthy. If such an adjustment becomes
habitual, he feels that the world is against him, that everyone
is trying to "get" him, that he is being "picked on." Then
he is well on the way to what the psychologist calls "delu-
sions of persecution." Real actions are usually better than
imaginary ones. Even in the case of the boy, it might have
been better if he had run away. Perhaps, then, there would
have been a real solution; perhaps, his parents would have
discovered that they were not fair. At any rate, the smolder-
ing sense of unfairness and injustice would have been
removed.
Introversion may take the form of identification. We
go
to a motion picture, and within the space of a few hours we
have loved, dared, killed, won the heroine, and lived happily
ever after. Much of the enjoyment we draw from the stage
and the moving pictures, the novel and the drama, the
concert hall and the radio is a kind of vicarious satisfaction
in the great exploits of the characters portrayed, with whom
we identify ourselves. There is much satisfaction and little
harm in such activities. However, it does seem as though we
66

MECHANISMS OF ADJUSTMENT TO FRUSTRATION
had gone a little too far nowadays in buying artificial
thrills. The danger is that we will leave the real accomplish-
ments to our fictitious characters and neglect to accomplish
anything for ourselves. Fancy has its place, but that place
is not as a substitute for action.
d. Rationalization.
"Rationalization" is a big name that is given to the
process of fooling ourselves and others as to the real reasons
for our actions or failures. For example, a man buys a large
and expensive radio set. There may be many reasons why
he should not do so-the grocery bill he owes, the insurance
he needs, the dress his wife should have, etc. However, he
does buy the radio. The real reason why he wanted the large
set was that all his friends had good radio sets and he desired
the social approval of having what everybody else had. This
reason is hardly the kind of motive that he would like to
admit to himself, let alone to anyone else, and so he finds
other reasons—the family will save money because they can
listen to the radio instead of spending money going some-
where else for their entertainment, there is a great educa-
tional value in radio, and so on. The main thing is that he
must find a reason that is acceptable to himself and that he
actually will accept.
Failures are usually attributed to something other than
our own deficiency of ability or effort. If we slice in golf, it is
the wind or the golf club or something else. If we fail in an
examination, the questions were unfair or the teacher was
poor. If we drink, we inherited the taste, the temptation
was irresistible, or our wives drove us to it. By such rationali-
zations we escape the annoying necessity of admitting our
own failures, and we achieve some degree of satisfaction in an
unsatisfying situation, in being able to fix the blame on our
ancestors or on circumstances. If we can get the blame fixed
where there can be no "come back," it is all the more satisfy-
ing; so the most common rationalization for failure is that
67


## p. 68 (#84) ##############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
we inherited a weakness or lack of ability from our parents.
If there is no one else on whom to project our troubles and
failures, we blame them on the Lord-we were made that way.
Or we may rationalize by making light of the desirability
of the goal sought but not realized. If we lose our job, the
job was no good anyway. If we are poor, money is the root of
all evil. If we are not beautiful, the pretty girl is always
dumb. We might rationalize our deficiencies by emphasizing
the desirabilities of what we have: In such ways we rational-
ize our lack of success and succeed in excusing our deficiencies
to ourselves. A rationalization is always convincing to our-
selves, whether or not it is to others. We accept it because it
places us in the best possible light.
Our thinking is full of beliefs, superstitions, and prejudices
that we have been able to keep impervious to evidence and
have rationalized so long that they are fixed. The man scrub-
bing the floors in the mental hospital and thinking he is a
king and the man who insists on the superiority of his race,
city, or make of automobile are both making use of the same
mechanism. They are both blind to some parts of the evi-
dence; and they are both guilty of watertight thinking
compartments.
e. Defense mechanisms.
Another form of adjustment to difficult situations, which
is not so common as those already mentioned, is usually
called defense mechanisms. Some examples of defense mechan-
isms are the examination nausea that keeps the ill-prepared
student from failure, the real but induced headache that
keeps someone from a difficult social situation, and some
forms of the so-called shell shock of wartime.
A defense mechanism is an organic condition of some kind
produced by a situation that is too difficult or unpleasant-
a condition that is adequate to remove the unpleasant situa-
tion. This does not mean that persons who use such means
are malingerers, because they are not. Often the condition.
68


## p. 69 (#85) ##############################################

MECHANISMS OF ADJUSTMENT TO FRUSTRATION
that results comes after a very serious conflict or struggle
between opposing motives, and the adjustment that is made
nonvoluntarily is the production of symptoms that keep the
individual from participating further in the disagreeable
situation.
f. Escape by means of drugs and alcohol.
One method of adjusting to difficulties, used frequently,
is to try to "drown" one's sorrows in alcohol or other drugs.
This cannot be anything but a temporary adjustment, as
the problems, difficulties, and frustrations are still there
when the effect of the drug has worn off.
g. Escape by running away.
This method of adjustment, sometimes called nomadism,
is rarely, if ever, successful. The individual who moves from
one job to another or from one town to another or from one
course to another, usually finds that his problems go with
him and that he cannot escape his frustrations by running
away
from them, as he usually takes them along with him.
h. Regression.
Regression is an attempt by the individual to find satisfac-
tion in a form of activity that, earlier in development, was
quite acceptable and satisfying, but that he had outgrown.
One example is that of the child who as a baby derived con-
siderable satisfaction from sucking his thumb, but who has
outgrown that activity. When he starts in school and finds
the situation difficult and lacking in satisfaction, he may
revert to the thumb-sucking activity. Another case is that of
the middle-aged man who, finding his life rather dull, may
regress to some form of behavior that was quite satisfactory
to him as an adolescent but that he had outgrown. This is a
rather unhealthy form of running away from frustration and
from problems.
69


## p. 70 (#86) ##############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
i. Sublimation.
The method of adjusting to thwarting known as sublima-
tion is used when the individual finds a new outlet for a
blocked motive. One very common form of frustration in our
civilization occurs because the appetite of sex matures and
becomes active years before the individual is able to achieve
a normal satisfaction in marriage. The young man or woman
can in this situation look for and find satisfactory indirect
ways of achieving some satisfaction of this powerful motive.
Dancing, games, athletics, and other forms of social activity
in which the individual may enjoy the company of persons
of the opposite sex are methods of achieving sublimation of
the sex motive; but sublimation is not confined to the appe-
tite of sex. Indeed, it may occur in the case of any blocked
motive.
j. Compensation.
Another form of adjustment to thwarting has been called
compensation. The unprepared student at an examination
fills his paper with volume to compensate for a lack of facts.
The man forced to be submissive and obedient at work may
be overbearing and dictatorial at home. There are some forms
of compensation that are undesirable, such as addiction to
alcohol or drugs as a compensation for failure in business.
Many, if not most, compensations are not only desirable but
highly beneficial to society. Many of the great achievements
in art, literature, and science have come as the result of a
wise compensation after the thwarting of some strong
motive. When there is an obstacle that prevents the active
motive's receiving its natural expression, the substitution of
some worth-while activity seems to be the best kind of ad-
justment that can be made.
It has been said that, if there were no taboos, restrictions,
laws, or prohibitions that inhibited the free expression of our
basic motives, there would be no mental illness or disorder.
Whether this is true or not, it certainly is true that if such a

condition of affairs prevailed there would also be no real
progress. It is only through difficulties and problems that
any really worth-while contributions are called for. As we
shall see in a later chapter, one essential condition of learning
is the presence of a problem. When the direct means of
satisfaction is barred, we invent new ways of doing things.
When the path of courtship is long and rough, great love
lyrics are born. The easy road never spurs men on to great
efforts; but difficulty, obstacles, and problems often call for
supreme efforts.

INFLUENCING
OTHER PEOPLE
LIFE
I. INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT
IFE presents many situations where it is necessary to
direct the course of action of other individuals. We
want them to buy our commodities, to vote for us, to partici-
pate in some project with us, and so on. Education, religion,
advertising, propaganda are organized attempts to influence
the course of behavior of people. Adequately to treat this
topic of how to direct the actions of others would require a
rather large-sized volume, so we must content ourselves here
with a mere outline of the more usual forms of social control
and hope that those readers who are interested will build on
this scant beginning by further reading.
Society has built up many rather elaborate techniques
for the purpose of influencing the actions of its members.
Education is a method of training the developing individual
into rather well-defined lines of activity. Laws are laid down
to regulate the activity of the members of an organized
society. Advertising has been invented as a means of direct-
ing the buying of nations, and incidentally has become a
very expensive means of social control. Fashion in dress,
speech, habits, and so on, is a powerful directing influence
on human behavior. Rewards and punishments of various
kinds are the usual techniques for coercing people into
definite lines of action. Praise, flattery, persuasion, threats,
commands, gossip, rumor, propaganda are a few of the uses
of language that are designed as ways of influencing the
behavior of other people. Most of these techniques work
through the basic motives that we have already discussed.
73


## p. 74 (#90) ##############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
There is one feature of social control that deserves a little
more attention at this point. This is the so-called force of
suggestion in directing the behavior of others. A person's
activity may be said to be directed by suggestion when he
accepts uncritically the ideas, requests, or example of another
person. When an individual adopts the ideas of others with-
out any real evaluation of those ideas, or when he does what
others do without thinking out this course of action for him-
self, he may be said to be acting on the suggestion received
from others. We are convinced by two kinds of influences-
by the statement of logical facts or carefully organized proofs
and by suggestion. By all odds the more common in human
life is suggestion. Thinking things out for oneself is not the
easiest way, so most of us adopt the short cut to conclusions
and ideas and ways of doing things, which is the acceptance
of the ideas and conclusions and methods of others.
The use of suggestion to control the behavior of other
people is very common. Suggestion may be thought of as
something to be guarded against or as a technique to be
employed; it all depends on whether we happen to be inter-
ested in safeguarding our own action or whether we are
interested in controlling the behavior of other people. How-
ever, no matter which interest we may have, we can learn
much from a brief study of the prominent features of the
process. The three important characteristics of suggestion
are (a) that an idea enters the mind from without, (b) that
this idea tends to produce action, (c) that the idea is ac-
cepted uncritically.
Every stimulus tends to produce action, or, in other words,
there is a tendency to respond to every stimulus received.
We do not react to all such stimuli, because there are other
things that hinder this response; but, if there are no such
inhibiting features, a response follows the stimulus. These
inhibiting features may be in the form of counterideas, or
habits, and the idea received is evaluated in the light of
these other ideas and established habits. This evaluation
74


## p. 75 (#91) ##############################################

INFLUENCING OTHER PEOPLE
does not always occur, and when it is absent we respond to
suggestion.
There are a number of conditions that are conducive to an
effective condition of suggestibility, or, in other words, that
predispose the individual to act on the suggestion rather
than to evaluate it. Indirect suggestions are more effective
than those that are direct; that is, if the idea is not obviously
the product of another but appears to arise within the mind
of the individual himself. A suggestion that seems to
strengthen ideas already present is usually productive of
action. A concentration of the attention on the suggestion
and the exclusion of other stimuli and thoughts usually
results in the suggested action. This is one of the main
techniques of hypnosis, which is an extreme form of sugges-
tion. Anything that indicates a condition of submission is a
condition productive of the acceptance of suggestions. A
child is usually submissive to an adult, and a child is usually
very suggestible. Differences in experience, reputation,
strength, social position may be effective in producing this
attitude of submissiveness and therefore suggestibility. We
are all suggestible to large numbers. If “everybody" is doing
it, this is often sufficient cause for our falling into line; that is,
unless we have built up habits of being negatively suggestible
to others.
2. SIMPLE TECHNIQUES USED IN INFLUENCING OTHERS
Everybody at some time or other, and most people quite
frequently, want or need to influence some other person or
persons. We often fail in this because we are ignorant of
human nature or because we do not use some rather simple.
but very effective techniques such as those that will be
described in the following paragraphs.
a. Capture his attention.
In order to influence anyone, it is necessary to capture his
attention; for the person who can effectively capture and
75


## p. 76 (#92) ##############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
hold the attention of others is the person who can influence
their behavior. One simple method of capturing the attention
of others is the use of dramatic movement. Things that move
catch our attention, whether they are moving lights or a
moving story; but movement or change alone, while it is
effective in capturing attention, will not hold that attention
unless it happens to be dramatic, that is, unpredictable.
Everyone possesses at least some curiosity; and anything
that seems to be going somewhere though he does not know
where, will hold his attention, at least long enough for him
to find out where. That is why it is so difficult to put down a
good detective story or a good love story until you have
finished it. Your curiosity has been aroused and you pay
attention until you find out who the murderer was, or
whether she finally marries him after all. If you know just
what the preacher or a lecturer is going to say, you might as
well go to sleep; but, if the speaker has succeeded in making
you curious, if he has set up a dramatic situation, or if he
has aroused a question in your mind, you simply must pay
attention until your curiosity has been satisfied or your
question has been answered.
b. Sympathetic induction of attitudes.
We produce in others the attitudes and feelings we show
ourselves. For instance, if we are trying to interest someone
in something, it is necessary to show an intense interest
ourselves, for interest tends to be infectious. A frank, cheerful
manner tends to produce the same in return. An irritable
teacher often is mirrored by her class. So, in order to produce
in others a desirable set of attitudes, the first essential is for
the individual to show these attitudes himself.
c. Get him started right.
It is much easier for an individual to continue in a direc-
tion than it is for him to change that direction of activity.
This means that, in order to influence an individual in any
76


## p. 77 (#93) ##############################################

INFLUENCING OTHER PEOPLE
line of activity, it is necessary to get him started right. It is
much harder to change a "no" into a "yes" than it is to
keep a person saying "yes" once he has begun. A door-to-
door book salesman illustrates this technique in the following
incident. He calls at a home and the door is opened by a busy
housewife. "Are you Mrs. Brown?" (He has ascertained her
name from a neighbor.) As this is her name there isn't much
for her to say except "Yes." "And you have three children?"
(Also picked up from the neighbor.) "Yes," again is her
answer. "And these children go to school?" Of course, again
her answer is "Yes." "And they have homework to do?"
Again her answer is "Yes." This continues until she has
yessed herself into buying an expensive set of books.
d. The use of newness or novelty.
A certain amount of newness or novelty is necessary to
catch the attention of people and influence them. However,
this novelty should not be too different or unfamiliar, for
people are a little afraid of things that are too strange and
different. On the other hand, they do not listen at all to the
old familiar story. Why should they? So, what is required is
a judicious mixture of the old and the new.
e. Recognize limitations.
There is a limit to what can be done at one time. There are
limits to the attention we can command, and there is a limit
to the amount of influencing that can be accomplished on one
occasion. We sometimes lose out because we try to do too
much at a time.
f. Appeal to basic wants and needs.
In order to influence anyone, it is necessary somehow to
appeal to basic wants and needs. The mere giving of informa-
tion rarely makes any difference to the person. For instance,
here's a boy who has been bombarded with facts about
health and hygiene by his parents, teachers, and public-

"This is for your own good," or "this is your duty," are
almost meaningless unless it is at the same time obvious
that the individual will receive some satisfaction of a
want or a desire that is present. Preaching, scolding, ex-
postulating are usually a waste of time. So, if you wish to

## p. 79 (#95) ##############################################

INFLUENCING OTHER PEOPLE
influence anyone, look for some fundamental motive and
hook your appeal to that.
g. Paint word pictures.
An appeal, to be effective, must be vivid. Most people are
visually minded; that is, they can see and understand pic-
tures better than they can explanation. Pictures often make a
difference to the person when cold facts leave him cold, too.
Tell a group how many crippled children there are and that
so much money is needed for their care, and appeal to them
by telling them that it is their duty to support such a worthy
cause, and you will be able to get a few contributions of loose
change. But make a group see vividly a child in need, paint
a picture that they can see, and many of them will be moved
to give even more than they can afford.
h. Breaking down defenses.
It is necessary to get past the ordinary defenses of people.
Today, most of us have been bombarded by so much high-
pressure advertising and salesmanship that it is necessary
to have some defense against it. Ordinary appeals no longer
affect us. We are better educated and better informed, as a
people, than we used to be. So, to get anywhere with attempts
to influence others we must arouse their latent interest and
break through their first line of defense. How is this done?
Try a little experiment. Take the advertisements, books,
motion pictures, plays, and articles that have interested you
lately. Examine these carefully, and try to determine what it
was that caught and held your attention and made a differ-
ence to you. You will probably find that it was not abstract
ideas but actual life situations. There may have been some-
thing different enough to arouse your curiosity, or something
unpredictable, a question implying an answer. You may
also find that the author or the producer has made use of the
shock technique. He has managed to shock you in some

way, so that you can never again think or feel the same about
some particular feature of life.
The story is told of a very effective use of this technique
by a member of a certain legislature, some years ago. He had
presented all the arguments, statistics, and appeals that he
knew to the legislature, in order to get an appropriation of
$100,000 for public-health purposes, but he seemed doomed
to failure; but before the vote was taken, adjournment
occurred, and he went to his office to try to figure out what
he could do. He knew that he had presented all the arguments
he had, and still he had not been able to influence the mem-
bers of the legislature. He thought about it for some time
before finally hitting on something that he thought was
worth trying. He put his stenographer to work and gained the
cooperation of the janitor. The next day, when the members
arrived at their offices, they found in the center of each
desk a sheet of paper. They were curious as to how it got
there, and most of them picked it up and read: “A sick
mother with a baby is told by her physician that she has
tuberculosis and that she should seek a higher altitude. Lack
of means prevents her from going. She appeals to the govern-
ment and is told that not a dollar is available to save the
mother and her child from death. At the same time, a farmer
notices that one of his hogs has cholera symptoms. He sends
a telegram collect to the government, and an inspector comes
the next day, treats the hog, and saves it. Moral-be a hog."
The bill passed without a voice raised against it.
If you wish to influence anyone, whether it be a customer,
a son or a daughter, a wife or a husband, a neighbor, or a
group of voters, here are some questions that you might ask
yourself about your methods. Does my presentation move?
Is there any dramatic suspense? Will it arouse curiosity?
What about my attitudes, manner, and feelings are they
the kind I want to see in the other person? Can I get him
started in the right direction? Is there anything new or
different in it? Am I trying to do too much at one time? What

need or want am I going to tap? Is my appeal vivid? How
am I going to get past the defenses of the individual?
3. EFFECTIVE SPEAKING
One very common method of attempting to influence
people is by means of public speaking. There are a number
of simple techniques that apply to public speaking that, if
kept in mind, should aid greatly in making the speaking
more effective.
a. Be prepared.
Know what you want to say. It is so difficult to listen to
the rambler that few will do so. Marshal your facts and
arrange them in such a way that they move and that your
audience moves with you to see where you are going.
b. Think of your audience.
Picture your audience—what they are like, what they are
interested in, and what they wish to hear.
c. Look at your audience.
Since it is to your audience that you are speaking, you
owe it to them to direct your eyes in their direction. This
means looking at all parts of the audience, so as to include
everybody.
d. Keeping attention.
Try to keep your audience active-thinking along with
you. This means that you need not do all the thinking. You
assume that they are intelligent and that they can follow
what you are saying and that they can fill in some things for
themselves.
e. Talk the language of your audience.
Never make your audience feel inferior. If you want the
members of the group to be influenced in an effective way,
81


## p. 82 (#98) ##############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
it is necessary not to try to show off by using words and ideas
that are unfamiliar to the listener. Instead of trying to indi-
cate that you know everything and the listener knows
nothing, make the audience feel that you are aware of their
intelligence and knowledge, and appreciate them.
f. The use of humor.
When you try to use humor, make sure that it is humor.
Good humor does not include any kind of belittling, espe-
cially belittling of members of the audience. Humor does help,
if it is real humor, but nothing falls quite so flat as an attempt
at humor that is not humorous.
g. Avoid extremes.
Avoid the ordinary and the extraordinary, as well. The
ordinary fails to arouse interest and attract attention, and
the extraordinary often arouses incredulity and causes the
audience to react against what you are saying. There must
be enough of the new and different to attract attention, but
not so much as to detract from your theme.
h. Know when to stop.
Stop when you have finished and before the audience has
gone to sleep. There is a limit to what any audience can take
in, and it is usually better to send them away wishing that
you had gone on longer than it is to have them wish that
you would come to the end.
What makes speaking dull and uninteresting? Stodginess
that is, lack of unfamiliar or new material mixed in
with the familiar; verbosity-too many words; circum-
locution-going round and round, without getting any
where; lack of clearness; lack of dramatic quality; monot-
ony-lack of high lights; generalities—lack of vivid pic-
tures—these are some of the factors that make speaking dull
and ordinary.

Chapter VII
THE REGULATION OF
CHILD BEHAVIOR
A
I. INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT
N IMPORTANT area of human activity in which the
knowledge of motivation can be applied with good
effect is that of the training and education of children. There
was a time not so very long ago when the good disciplinarian
was thought to be the person who could and did make
children under his care tremble with fear, jump to obey his
commands, and in general behave as well-behaved children
should; but this point of view is changing rapidly. No longer
do we think of discipline as stern repression and the giving
of commands that must be obeyed. No longer can the teacher
or the parent depend on the big stick and his assumed
authority to keep children in order. In fact, we are sure now
that such methods are not only undesirable but actually
harmful to the well-being and normal development of chil-
dren. The discipline of fear and strict punishment is out of
fashion, and rightly so. It has taken a long time to advance
from this old method, and the need for reform has not been
completely met as yet. In this chapter we will develop
briefly what we call a reasonable scheme of discipline, based
on knowledge and experience of what various techniques and
influences do to the developing child.
2. TWO EXTREMES IN DISCIPLINE
The main difficulty in the reforms of discipline today is
that many can think only in terms of opposites or extremes.
If the old, traditional discipline of fear and trembling is not
the best way, then they think we must go to the other
84


## p. 85 (#101) #############################################

THE REGULATION OF CHILD BEHAVIOR
extreme-have no control or regulation of children at all, let
them do as they wish, allow them free expression. However,
this does not necessarily follow. The discipline of fear is
based on the idea that the child was by nature “bad” and
must be treated in such a way that the badness would not
be allowed to come out. He must be hemmed in by all kinds
of regulations and penalties; he must be treated harshly,
bossed, punished occasionally; or else he would become
spoiled the badness would come out. The other extreme
position is that the child is by nature "good"; therefore, he
should be allowed to do as he pleases, he should be allowed
to express himself, he must not be regulated, his goodness
should be given a chance to come out.
What has been the result of these two extreme positions
and their related techniques? The discipline of fear produced
in the main, "good" children, who did what they were told
to do, who gave little trouble, who were well behaved. But
these same children, obedient and submissive, turned out
to be in a great many cases adults who couldn't run their
own lives very satisfactorily, who carried with them the
effects of fear and lack of initiative, who contributed very
little to the business of living. The discipline of free expres-
sion produced children (and adults too) who had failed to
learn some of the essential lessons of living, who thus tended
to run rough-shod over all necessary social restrictions-
who were, in short, a nuisance.
3. A REASONABLE SCHEME OF DISCIPLINE
There is no reason why we must go to either of these ex-
tremes in discipline. There is a middle course, which we will
describe as a reasonable scheme of discipline, a method that
preserves the best in both extremes.
The child when he is newly born knows nothing, must learn
everything. He is completely incapable of directing his own
affairs and making his own decisions. Someone else must
85


## p. 86 (#102) #############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
direct his activities. Because of his immaturity and igno-
rance, the regulation of his behavior must rest with someone
else. But when this same person has become an adult, he
must take charge of his own life; he must regulate his be-
havior for himself, make his own decisions, and run his own
affairs. Between the infant whose affairs must be controlled
by someone else and the adult, who should control his own
activity, is the child, developing, learning, growing. This
child must be protected from making too many costly
errors, must be helped to learn what will help him to live

happily and effi-
ciently; but we must
never lose sight of
the fact that this
child will some day
be an adult and
thus, we hope, be
self-regulated. This,
then, is the goal and
guiding principle of
all discipline for the
child-that he is
being prepared for
self-control, self-discipline. This is a long-term view that
must be taken. It isn't good enough to think only of
today and the production of a well-behaved child, obedient
to all commands; we must remember his tomorrows, when
we expect him to do more than to obey-to show initiative,
self-control, and self-regulation. Thinking of the tomorrows
means that we should provide plenty of opportunities for him
now to practice self-regulation, to make choices and decisions.
To these ends, it is not enough for discipline just to keep
children good and quiet, but it should provide opportunities
for learning and the practice of living with others. Discipline
is arranging conditions for effective learning not just
reading, writing, and arithmetic, but all phases of the busi-

child expects a reward for anything and everything that
he does. He begins to develop an attitude of "what's there

fails to learn that some things just must be done because they
are a necessary part of the business of living.

something that they shouldn't do, the simplest and easiest
method is some form of punishment-the strap, the hair-
brush, stern disapproval, or some other form of artificial
negative incentive that produces fear and thus inhibits

## p. 88 (#104) #############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
action. Even though punishments work as they do, they are
not the best method in terms of our long-term objective of
producing self-regulating adults. Punishments have had an
interesting history. They began as revenge. The individual
had violated some law or custom of the tribe or the family,
and he must be paid back for it, the tribe or the family must
have its revenge. Then, punishments have been used as a
method of deterring from crime, as a method of scaring the
individual from wrongdoing. Finally, punishments became
a method of reform. But none of these excuses for the use of
punishment are adequate. Punishment is a poor method of
guiding children, mainly because it is personal-there is a
punisher, as well as a person punished. The person punished
always resents the punishment and cannot feel happy toward
the punisher. In child guidance and training, the most
important factor is the relationship between the adult
(parent or teacher) and the child. Punishment tends to
destroy the confidence, trust, sympathy, understanding, and
affection that should exist between the adult and the child.
Of course, the child should not be allowed to do as he likes;
and, of course, there must be some form of regulation by the
adult. This regulation, however, should be as impersonal as
possible; that is, the child is required to live up to the neces-
sary rules of everyday ilving. He cannot escape the require-
ments of the situations of home and school and community.
These requirements should be clearly indicated and under-
stood by the child as necessities of living, not just whims of
parents and teachers. If he fails to live up to these require-
ments, then he must suffer the logical consequences of his
own behavior. The adult must see to it that these conse-
quences are enforced, not as punishments with a personal
flavor, but as impersonal consequences that the child has
brought on himself by his own behavior.
Furthermore, affection should never be used as a method
of motivating the child. He should never be led to think that
his parents will not love him as much if he acts in a certain
88

THE REGULATION OF CHILD BEHAVIOR
way; nor should they say or imply that they will love him
more if he does what they wish him to. This is a personal
kind of regulation, which hinders the child from learning
some of the important lessons of living. For instance, the
child learns to wash his hands before meals, not just to please
a fussy mother but because washing hands is what is done.
He learns to be honest, not just because father wants him to
be honest, but because honesty is a necessity in effective
living.
4. LIVING BY THE RULES AND HELPING TO MAKE THE RULES
There is a valuable lesson that every child should learn
as early as possible. It is that life consists of two kinds of
activity—those things that just must be done, whether he
wants to do them or not, and the other things that he may
do or not, as he likes. In other words, the child should not be
allowed to do as he likes, but he must do many things that
he does not want to do and may not enjoy doing very much,
but that are necessary. They are necessary, not because some
teacher or parent thinks they are necessary, but because
the situation demands them. In other words, the “musts”
are not whims of adults, but necessities inherent in the situa-
tion itself. These "musts" and "must nots" are balanced
with the activities that are free activities-things that may
be done or not, as the child likes. In other words, he has free
expression as well as outside regulation. The outside regula-
tion is impersonal—not a matter of adult whim, but a regula-
tion demanded by the life situation itself. And there must
be a balance between the regulation and the freedom-
enough freedom so that the child will not feel hemmed in by
regulations, and enough regulations so that he will learn that
living in a world with other people demands certain things
of him.
Further, the child himself should have a hand in the mak-
ing of the rules and regulations that he is going to live up
to. This is the basis of democratic living-that each indi-

be given every opportunity to help make the laws of the
classroom, the playground, and the home. There's a different
feeling tone to obeying laws that you have had a hand in
making, and in obeying the dictates of the lawmaker who
sits at the front of the classroom or the head of the dinner
table. If we want obedient little machines who always jump
when we open our mouths, then the authoritative method
is what we should use; but if we want persons who can think
for themselves and run their own lives, then we must give
them practice in doing just that.

and regulations that make demands on them, but yet are
not just the cranky ideas of the old grouch who has assumed
an authority he doesn't deserve just because he happens to
have been hired as a teacher or who is by a biological chance
his parent. "Reasonable" means that there is a reason for
the regulation or demand and a reason that can be under-
stood by the child. Very often we fail to give the child credit
for as much ability to understand as he has. Instead of “Do
this because I say so," let him hear, “Do this because it is
the kind of behavior that the situation demands."
Children are persistent imitators, especially of those whom
they love and admire. On this account, one of the most
effective methods of education is that of setting a pattern
to be followed. Listen to a group of small children at play
and you are almost sure to hear the bossy voice imitating
some teacher or parent directing other children. Listen again,
and you will hear the usual adult techniques with children—
the command-obey method, the big-stick method, the voice
of authority, the coaxing method, the bribe, the threat of
punishment a rather sordid picture of human relations.
Children learn the patterns of social living that they see;
it's all that they can learn. They learn to be intolerant, to be
snobbish, to be inconsiderate of others, to be selfish, if those
are the patterns that they have to follow; or they learn good
manners and good moral standards, tolerance, unselfishness,
consideration, if these are the patterns prevalent in their
world. Children learn far more than what they are con-
sciously taught. In fact, it would seem that the most impor-
tant things they learn they acquire through imitation of
others, especially parents, teachers, and other adults who
are near and dear to them. The child mirrors fairly accurately
the social environment in which he lives.
Rules and regulations are indispensable in human rela-
tions. A well-run society must have them; but the real
danger in the classroom and the home is the multiplication
91

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
of rules. No wonder the child occasionally rebels and tries to
get away with breaking them. He feels so hemmed in by the
rules that, in order to maintain his self-respect as an indi-
vidual, he must break the rules. So, in a reasonable scheme
of discipline, there are as few rules as possible, and every
rule is important and essential. These minimum essentials
are fully understood by the child; he is helped to understand
their necessity and value; he has helped to draft them, and
he helps to enforce them. He knows that they are not just
the adult's idea but a necessary part of the business of a
group getting along together. The child chooses whether he
will live up to those rules or not—if not, then he must
accept the consequences of his choice. The consequence is,
again, not the whim of the adult but the logical natural
outcome of his noncompliance. It usually takes the form of
his being deprived of the advantages of the group situation,
so that the child learns that belonging to a group-a family,
a gang, a class, etc.-carries with it the responsibilities of
accepting the requirements of the group rules.
SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER
The Regulation of Child Behavior
Discipline, then, is not just punishing children but a method of
arranging conditions for learning. It can be reasonable, impersonal,
suitable to the stage of development of the child, and productive
of individuals who are self-disciplined. It need go to the extreme
neither of strict, stern, uncompromising restriction and severe pun-
ishment, nor of allowing unbridled and unrestrained freedom. It
can take a middle course in which rules and regulations are bal-
anced with freedom, so that over all there is an atmosphere of
cordial cooperation between adult and child. The goal and guid-
ing principle is the guidance of the developing child toward an
adulthood of self-control and productive activity. Obedience for
the sake of obedience is no longer a virtue, but an understanding
acceptance of the necessary rules of the game of living with other
people. Guidance and learning take the place of authority and

the command-obey relationship between adult and child. The child
is learning to live by living in a democratic social group in which
he is practicing self-government. Adult and child become partners

Chapter VIII
FEELINGS AND
EMOTIONS
E
VERY activity and experience of the individual has a
coloring of feeling. Life would be very drab and unin-
teresting if it were not for the constantly changing feeling
tone that is a feature of all activity. From a purely objective
point of view, it makes no difference how the individual feels,
as long as he goes through the necessary motions; but to the
individual himself it matters a great deal how he feels about
what he is doing. He evaluates experiences in terms of his
feelings, and these feelings determine to a considerable
extent the occurrence and repetition of activity. Before we
can have a complete picture of the individual's activity, we
need to consider this aspect of all activity-the background
of feeling. There are occasions when the individual undergoes
a radical upheaval of the feelings, when he is emotionally
disturbed, and this feature also claims some of our attention.
I. CHARACTERISTICS OF FEELINGS
The feeling coloring of any activity is not a fixed or regular
feature of that activity. A certain activity may be very
pleasant at one time, while the same activity might have
just the opposite coloring on another occasion. There are
many conditioning factors. Why is it that one day all experi-
ences seem clouded and unpleasant, while another day
things seem rosy and "all's well with the world"? It depends
largely on habits of feeling, for there are habits and modifica-
tions of habits here, as in all psychological functions. The
likes and dislikes that dictate activity are often fixed habits
of feeling about particular objects and events. Most persons
build up habits of food preference, which, although they
94


## p. 95 (#111) #############################################

FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS
may have no basis in biological utility or actual taste or
nutritional values, determine what these persons will or will
not eat. Such preferences, or definite feeling tones connected
with particular objects, have been acquired, usually in some
rather obscure manner. Father makes some unfavorable
remark about carrots, and the highly suggestible Johnny
acquires a dislike for this item of diet. Johnny comes to the
table with no appetite because he has been eating between
meals; Johnny is forced to eat up his dinner; and, just as
likely as not, Johnny has thus acquired a dislike for some
kind of food.
We form a strong dislike for someone we have met, and
there is no apparent reason for our dislike. Why? Perhaps
by a subtle process this new acquaintance suggests to us
some other individual whom we may have known and dis-
liked. His appearance, his clothes, his voice, his manner, or
any one of a dozen other features may have been similar in
the two cases. The resemblance probably isn't strong enough
to arouse a direct recall of the other individual, yet it is close
enough to call forth this feeling of dislike. Thus, the ways of
feeling are obscure and subtle, but extremely important in
daily existence.
Besides the established habits of feeling, there are other
factors determining the character of the feeling that accom-
panies any activity. Emotional experiences perseverate or
last and leave their imprint, exerting an influence on subse-
quent experiences. An individual aroused to the white heat
of anger has all his experiences colored by the residue of that
anger for some time. He is in an angry mood, and the mood
dictates the feeling tone. The condition of the physical
organism also has much to do with the feeling tone of the
moment. Any physical disorder has widespread effects on
mental function; a stomach-ache can change the whole com-
plexion of the day's experiences. Anyone who is in the posi-
tion of meeting people in order to produce some desired
behavior knows how important it is to "catch the prospect

in good humor" or, failing that, to dispel a persisting coloring
of unpleasantness. Feelings play an important part in
behavior.
Feelings are constantly changing. It is very difficult to
study them, because, when we attend to a feeling tone, it
changes entirely or disappears. There are no known sense
organs for feelings of pleasantness and unpleasantness. They
are diffuse and are not located in any part of the body. There
are probably only two kinds of feelings-pleasantness and
unpleasantness—although there are many shades of these
and many descriptive adjectives to describe the different
ATTITUDE OF APPROACH
PLEASANT
ATTITUDE OF WITHDRAWAL
UNPLEASANT
Between the two kinds of feelings-pleasantness and unpleasantness-are
many shades of feeling. Likewise, our attitudes vary in degrees from one
of approach to anything pleasant to one of withdrawal from that which
we find unpleasant.
varieties of these basic feelings. These feelings accompany
all activity and are not separate experiences; that is, they
are never experienced in isolation. The duration of an experi-
ence modifies its feeling tone; so that, if a pleasant experi-
ence is continued for any length of time, it may change into
an unpleasant experience.
Feelings are not unrelated to action, because feelings have
a behavior side as well. The feeling of pleasantness is closely
bound up with the attitude of approach, and the feeling of
unpleasantness is accompanied by the attitude of with-
drawal. To put this in another way, we characteristically
approach, or try to sustain, a pleasant experience and with-
draw from, or try to terminate, an unpleasant experience.
These attitudes are always present, although they may be
inhibited by other considerations. Feelings are thus guides
for conduct. So, beside being the background of activity,
feelings may also be the directors of activity.
96


## p. 97 (#113) #############################################

FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS
Every situation that calls for an adjustment by the
individual is evaluated, and this evaluation is in terms of the
feeling tone of pleasure or the reverse. The process does not
stop with evaluation but also results in an attitude toward
the situation. This attitude may be one of approach or
acceptance if the situation is evaluated as pleasant or an
attitude of withdrawal or rejection if the situation is evalu-
ated as unpleasant. These attitudes and feelings, as has been
already pointed out, are not by any means fixed or rigid.
They are subject to change and undergo considerable modi-
fication during development.
2. CHARACTERISTICS OF EMOTIONS
Emotions are emergency equipment. Anything that
upsets the even adjustment of the individual or threatens
life or disturbs the peace of mind of the individual is an
emergency. Emergencies are too numerous and varied to list
here. What do we do in an emergency? We fight, we flee, or
we do nothing at all. It depends on circumstances. The very
same kind of emergency may cause the individual to be
angry and fight at one time, while at another time he will be
afraid and take to flight, and again he may do nothing.
Emotional activity does not require a real emergency to
put it into action. A man may become angry when his dinner
is delayed or when the children are too noisy or when his collar
button rolls under the dresser. He can, and often does, lose
control of things and stamp his feet and roar and say things
that he will be ashamed of later. Anger and fear are two
common forms of emotional adjustment that normally occur
only in real emergencies but that may become habitual
forms of adjustment and occur in all kinds of situations.
Emotions can be trained and educated and made to take
second place to ideals. We will fight for our lives in emer-
gency; but we will stand quietly by and allow women and
children to be saved first, if our training has been sufficient
to make us respect the rights of the weak. Fear is a powerful

motive, perhaps one of the most powerful. It has driven men
to ridiculous lengths to escape its consequences.
What is the stimulus for anger? Dr. J. B. Watson found
that the only way he could produce an anger response in
very young infants was to restrict their freedom of move-
ment. If he held the arms close to the sides of the baby, the
infant would struggle vigorously. Likewise, if he held the
nostrils and thus interfered with breathing, the child showed
a characteristic anger response. Obstacles arouse the emotion
of anger. Thwarting or interfering with the free expression
of the basic appetites and needs of the individual may be an
adequate stimulus for rage. Anger as a response to obstacles
is also a means of overcoming them, but the difficulty is that
the anger response is sometimes so violent and unorganized
that the results may be disastrous.
Anger can be trained and modified. We do not learn how

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
to get angry, but we do learn what to be angry about and
when to control the emotion, as well as how to express anger
in a socially acceptable way. The child has a temper tantrum,
throws himself on the floor and kicks and screams, and gives
himself over completely to his rage. What happens? Usually
the parents run to his rescue, give him whatever he wants,
solve the problem that brought on the expression of rage;
they are willing to do almost anything to stop this rather
awful spectacle. The child has learned that the expression of
anger in an extreme fashion is a useful tool to influence the
action of others. As he grows older, he learns that such a
means doesn't work with everybody and he has to modify it;
but whenever the emotional response is successful, it is
strengthened and, whenever it is not successful, it is weak-
ened. Thus, the history of emotional upsets determines their
future use as a form of adjustment. Temper tantrums in a
mild form may persist as a form of adjustment. We are all
familiar with the adult who slams doors and stamps his feet
and indulges in other ridiculous activities when he cannot
have his own way.
Anger in the adult results from interference with the
attainment of goals. Distractions and interruptions when we
are busy are likely to call out sudden flashes of anger. Attacks
on our self-respect, interference with what we think of as
our own private affairs, derogatory comments about our
cherished beliefs, reflections on our honor and integrity are
all obstacles thrown in the way of our purposes, desires, and
goals and are thus usually adequate stimuli for the anger
response. The attacks do not need to be directed specifically
at our own activities in order to arouse anger. Anything that
we are interested in our friends, our church, our club, our
town, our nation—if attacked, may arouse our anger and
summon us to their defense.
Anger has more than one form of expression. While it may
cause an individual to fly into a rage and smash things, it
may also be expressed in more subtle ways. Social custom

dictates that violent expressions of anger are to be frowned
on; but social custom permits the venting of rage in taunts,
sarcasm, threats, and verbal abuse if it is sufficiently veiled
in conventional language. Indirect and subtle ways of ex-
pressing anger are limited only by the ingenuity of the
individual. Anger may be aroused and expressed in a great
variety of
ways.
Anger is not without its value. It is productive of a vigor-
ous and aggressive and determined kind of attack on diffi-
culties and obstacles in the attainment of desired ends and
goals, although it often defeats its own purposes by its very
violence. Obstacles to social progress, social evils of various
kinds often persist until someone stirs up enough people to a
pitch of righteous indignation sufficient to produce results.

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
people have a rather well-stocked museum of fears. Fear is a
natural reaction to a certain number of situations. We do not
have to learn to be afraid, but we do learn to be afraid of
many things that we did not originally fear. Dr. J. B. Watson
found that young children were afraid of only two situations,
loud noises and the removal of support. But, you say, chil-
dren are afraid of the dark, of strange people, of strange
places, of dogs, rats, lightning, and thousands of other things.
Yes, but they learned to be afraid of these things. Watson
took an infant whose only reaction to a rat was curiosity and
the desire to stroke it and play with it, and when the child
was stroking the fur of the rat, Watson made a loud bang
behind the back of the child. The child was afraid, trembled,
and cried in terror. This was repeated once more, and what
happened? The child was afraid of the rat, screamed with
terror when it was brought into the room. The child had
learned to fear the rat, because of the association of the rat
with the loud sound-not just that rat but any rat, any furry
animal, and even his aunt who wore fur around her neck.
Johnny will not leave things alone in the parlor, so his
mother invents a bogey man who "gets" little boys when
they are naughty. Mary persists in going out of the yard,
so her poor distracted mother invents bad men who carry
little girls away. When little Charlie won't eat his breakfast,
mother tells him that the policeman will come and take him
to jail. Soon the minds of these children are crammed full of
imaginary dangers and emergencies that must be feared.
Mother is afraid of thunderstorms. She runs and hides when
the lightning flashes, and her little brood soon learn to fear
the storms. Tender little minds listen to gruesome stories
before the children are put to bed; then the dark is peopled
with all kinds of fearsome monsters. Sometimes in church hell
fire is held up as an object of fear to scare men into being good.
Fear is unnecessary. It should be left behind with other
childish things. Fear has had a too prominent place in human
life. Many unnecessary fears are taught. One nation learns
102


## p. 103 (#119) ############################################

FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS
to fear another, one race fears another with often serious
results, which need never have come about if the fear
had not been built up in the first place. As long as fear
dominates the nations, there will be wars and rumors of
wars. Anything may become a feared object. It all depends
on experience and training. Fear is inefficient. An intelligent
understanding of a situation is much more effective as a
starting point to dealing with that situation than a fear of
that situation can possibly be.
Like anger, fear may have various expressions. It does not
always produce flight. It may lead the individual to avoid
danger situations or to take a more cautious and alert atti-
tude on such occasions. Fear may produce a complete
paralysis of all action so that the individual will be incapable
of doing anything but scream with terror or faint. Fear is
aroused by any present or imagined danger. What the
individual will do in such situations depends to a great
extent on his previous experience and training. Fear is a real
motive or director of activity. It has been used by the church,
the state, and the home as a means of arousing certain kinds
of activity. Fear may become the habitual adjustment to any
new situation; then a shy, overcautious, inhibited individual
will be the result.
3. THE ORGANIC STATE IN FEAR AND ANGER
When an individual is emotionally upset, there are far-
reaching organic effects. An emotion is in part an organic
response to an emergency, either real or imagined. In an
emergency the organism concentrates all its energy for the
attack or the flight, as the case may be. A person chased by
an angry bull can actually run faster and jump higher than
he could under normal conditions. Digestion normally goes
on in an automatic way; the smooth muscles of the digestive
system contract in a rhythmic manner. When an emergency
arouses an emotion, all this stops. Professor Cannon placed
a cat, which had just had a meal, in an apparatus that made
103


## p. 104 (#120) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
it possible to observe the process of digestion. While the
digestive activities were functioning in a normal manner, he
introduced a dog into the room. The cat, afraid of the dog,
gave all the signs of fear; the digestive process stopped alto-
gether and remained suspended for some time after the cause
of fear had been removed. The heart is also a smooth muscle
going about its work without conscious control, but in an
emotional state the action of the heart is speeded up. The
increased flow of blood is diverted from the visceral organs
to the large muscles of the limbs. In an emotional state the
lungs are stimulated to increased breathing. The adrenal
glands normally pour a small amount of their secretion-
adrenalin-into the blood stream; but, when the person is
emotionally aroused, the flow of this substance is greatly
increased. The action of this increased supply of adrenalin
is to prepare the organism for strenuous action. It aids in the
stopping of the digestion; it probably stimulates the liver
to release more fuel for the muscles; it helps to increase the
circulation of the blood and even increases the clotting power
of the blood. What is the significance of all these organic
changes? They are preparations for action. They cannot
be thought of as the result of emotional experience, but must
be considered as a very real part of the emotion itself. An
emotion is a wrought-up, disturbed, moved state of the
individual, and one part of this disturbed condition includes
the organic happenings mentioned above.
4. OTHER EMOTIONS
Although fear and anger are the most important and far-
reaching of the emotions, there are other affective states
that may be called emotions and there are many words that
serve as names for emotional states. These various emotional
states can be distinguished in terms of the situations in which
they occur. Joy is the emotional response to success, surprise
to an unexpected happening, grief to loss of a cherished per-
son or object, disgust to an offensive situation, and so on.
104


## p. 105 (#121) ############################################

FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS
These emotional states are not so clear-cut or extensive in
their effects as are fear and anger.
Joy is an emotional condition that is aroused by the attain-
ment of some very much desired goal. There is a rather
widespread organic reaction that is experienced as an intense
feeling of pleasantness or exhilaration. Joy is usually the
result of action rather than the motive for action, as are
emotions of fear and anger.
The emotion of surprise results from a sudden, unex-
pected, and unusual situation. This emotion may be a part
of the emotion of fear that results from a sudden emergency.
Surprise is an emotional state that occurs when the individual
is unable to adjust to the unexpected situation at once. This
is characteristic of most emotion; the emotion results when
there is an inability on the part of the individual to adjust
in any adequate way to a present situation. When the indi-
vidual can and does make an adequate adjustment, no
emotion results; but when no such adjustment is possible,
the energy released by the stimulus seems to become dammed
up and produces rather widespread disturbance.
Disgust is the emotional condition resulting primarily
from the taste or odor of filthy or decaying objects. During
development, this emotion may spread to anything remotely
associated with the primary stimulus. Unsanitary conditions,
uncleanliness, obscenities, as well as many other kinds of
conditions, become the stimulus for the emotion of disgust.
Grief is the emotional state that results from the loss of
something or some person near and dear to the individual.
The emotion results because there is no adequate form of
behavior to take care of the situation. If we could do
thing about it, there would probably be no emotion; but,
as no satisfactory activity is possible, emotion is the result.
5. EXPRESSION OF EMOTIONS
any-
A child expresses his emotions fairly clearly in his facial
expression; but as the child grows up he learns to moderate
105


## p. 106 (#122) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
his expressions of fear and anger, joy and disgust. Social
pressure demands that he conceal his emotions as much as
possible. He is made fun of when he shows fear and reproved
when he expresses anger; so he soon learns to hide his
emotional states as much as possible from other people. On
the other hand, we are continually trying to read the emo-
tions of other people by means of their facial expressions.
Social custom dictates that emotions be not paraded in
public and yet social custom also demands that we act in
accordance with the feelings of other people. As a result,
there is a race between concealment of emotions and the
reading of emotions.
When facial expression alone is used to determine the
emotional condition of others, there is a great possibility
of error. Experiments making use of posed photographs
indicate that in the case of some emotions it is very difficult
to read the emotion from the facial expression alone. In actual
life, of course, we make use of a great many other clues, such
as the objective situation, what the individual is doing, his
vocal expression, words and inflections, gestures, and so on.
6. MOODS
Whereas an emotion is usually of short duration and very
intense, a mood is usually of long duration and rather mild.
Moods reflect to a considerable extent the organic condition
of the individual. Grouchiness, irritability, sulkiness, de-
pression, "blues" may be traced back in many cases to an
unhealthy condition of the vital functions of digestion and
elimination of waste products. The cheerful, optimistic,
happy moods go hand in hand with a properly functioning
organism. Moods may result from a previous emotional con-
dition. The white heat of anger may subside into a sullen,
resentful, belligerent mood. When he is in this mood the
individual is easily aroused to anger again.
Besides the organic condition and the residual effects of a
strong emotion, moods may be the result of events and
106


## p. 107 (#123) ############################################

FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS
experiences. Success in any project may produce a mood of
cheerfulness and optimism, which may persist for some time,
while failure is likely to induce a gloomy, resentful mood.
Moods are closely related to action. Besides being an
affective coloring of activity like the feelings to which they
are closely related, moods exert an influence on the course of
our thoughts and the direction of our actions. Even the
character of our perceptions is determined to a considerable
extent by the prevalent mood. Perception, as we shall see,
is the process of ascribing meaning or significance to a body
of sense data. Obviously, the character of the perceiving
process is determined to a certain extent by the mood of the
moment. The process of imagination and thinking is also
determined to a considerable extent by the mood of the
individual. If the mood is one of melancholy, the daydreams
and imaginations are colored by this condition, while the
characteristic train of thought of the cheerful person is of a
very different nature.
There is a mutual interaction between the organic con-
dition of the individual and his emotional experiences. The
organic condition helps to determine the affective back-
ground, and the feeling tone or mood influences the organic
condition. Continual worry or emotional excitement are not
conducive to a healthy functioning of the vital functions of
the individual. An affective coloring of pleasantness and a
prevalent mood of cheerfulness exert a tonic effect on the
organism.
7. SENTIMENTS
Sentiments are complex emotional states directed toward
some specific object or person. Through the course of experi-
ence some particular emotional state becomes associated
with a particular object, and the characteristic emotional
response to that object is fairly permanent. This is called a
sentiment. The two most prominent sentiments are love and
hate. Hate is a complex emotional attitude directed toward
107


## p. 108 (#124) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
a certain person or object. It is a combination of fear and
anger and irritation. Love is also a complex emotional condi-
tion centering around a particular person. Patriotism is
another example of a complex emotional state toward a
particular object. There are many other sentiments, such as
religious, aesthetic, and social sentiments, which are highly
complex and are all directed toward particular objects. There
may be also self-regarding sentiments or emotional states
directed toward oneself. All these sentiments have their
directing influence on the activity of the individual.
We have dealt in this chapter with the affective back-
ground of activity or the experiential coloring of behavior,
as well as the radical emotional disturbances to which the
individual is subject. In discussing these features of the
individual's activity, we have been forced to notice that
activity is influenced and directed by these features. This is
a part of the larger topic of motivation, which was dealt with
earlier. It should be noted again that the emotions, moods,
sentiments, and feelings can be thought of as one kind of
motivation, or directing influence, for human behavior.

Chapter IX
EMOTIONAL CONTROL
T
I. INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT
HE day-by-day happiness and efficiency of the indi-
vidual depend on his ability to control and manage his
emotional life. His feelings and emotions can make his life
miserable or happy, depending on the degree of control that
he has achieved over them. The person who swings fre-
quently from extreme elation to deep depression is in need
of emotional reeducation. He who is hampered in his activity
by a variety of vague but powerful fears could be helped to a
happier and more efficient life if the fears were removed.
Worry can make anyone not only miserable but inefficient.
Emotions are subject to training and education. No one
need continue to have hampering fears or an unruly temper.
These are a matter of habit, and habits can be changed.
There is a close relationship between health and the
emotional condition of the individual. It is difficult, if not
indeed impossible, for a person to be healthy when he has
unhealthy fears and emotional conditions. Worry, vague
fears, and frequent emotional upsets are contributing con-
ditions to some forms of illness. For health and happiness,
emotional control is essential
Emotional disturbance is an enemy of efficiency. Emotion
and reason form a kind of balance; when one goes up, the
other goes down. The more emotional the individual is, the
less efficient he becomes; for when emotional disturbance
occurs, reasoned, intelligent, efficient action is impossible.
Emotional disturbance brings a loss of efficiency in fine
muscular coordination as well as in intelligent control in
adjustment.

EMOTIONAL CONTROL
Emotional control is a matter of habit formation; that
is, it is acquired. The best time to acquire emotional con-
trol is during development. However, if an individual has
reached adulthood without such emotional maturity, it is
not too late; for to one who really wishes to attain them,
emotional control and emotional reeducation are possible
at any age.
2. TRAINING IN EMOTIONAL CONTROL
EMOTION
REASON
Education of the emotions has been a neglected phase of
education, although we are now beginning to realize the
importance in guiding children toward an emotional ma-
turity that will help
to increase both effi-
ciency and happi
ness. Training in the
management of the
emotional life of a
person can and

should begin very early in development and continue
through his growing years. Emotional control does not
require the inhibition of emotions or the removal of emotional
experiences, but it does imply the harnessing of the energy of
the emotions to a useful purpose. Fears can be, and often
are, a very real hindrance to efficient living, and most fears
should be unlearned. Anger is often a spur to action, but if
the anger gets out of control the action that results is not
efficient or useful.
a. Removing fears from children.
From experiments, much valuable information has been
gathered about children's fears and techniques of dealing
with them. The child starting out in life with very few
definite fears soon acquires a considerable variety of fears.
It is normal for the young child to have fears, but these
can be removed as he grows older. Some methods that have
III


## p. 112 (#128) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
not proved to be very helpful should be mentioned. One such
method is the method of disuse; that is, keeping the feared
object or situation from the child for some time. This
method has been shown to be ineffective, as when the child
experiences the object or situation after such an interval of
disuse, his fear is often as intense as before. This indicates
that fears, to be conquered, must be faced and adjusted to,
as they do not just evaporate into thin air. Another method
that has shown poor results is the "familiarity breeds con-
tempt" idea, or frequent contact with the feared object in
the hope that the child will become accustomed to it and
thus not fear it. But frequent presentation without the child's
being helped to adjust in some way to it succeeds only in
making the fear more intense than it was before. Another
common method, which is actually dangerous, is the method
of ridicule; that is, making fun of the child for his fears. This
usually causes him to try to hide his fear and, because he
thus bottles up the fear without making a satisfactory
adjustment, the fear sometimes becomes even more serious
than before. Verbal appeals-telling the child there is noth-
ing to be afraid of or that it is silly to be afraid or that there
is no cause for fear-do not help the child, as often such
statements only succeed in confirming him in his idea that
there is something to be feared.
A method that has at least occasional success is the method
of social imitation. This means that the child is exposed to
the fear situation in company with someone in whom he has
confidence and who does not show any fear. That is, the
child can learn to overcome his fear of dogs, for instance, if
he plays with other children who obviously enjoy the com-
pany of dogs.
The reconditioning method, if it is carefully used, is usually
successful in removing fears. By "reconditioning" we mean
that the feared object is presented along with something else,
which calls forth a happy feeling and a positive reaction.
If skillfully arranged, the happy feeling and the positive

EMOTIONAL CONTROL
reaction become transferred to the feared object and the
fear disappears.
Knowledge and skill are enemies of fear, while ignorance
and inefficiency are allies of fear. Many fears—indeed, most
fears of children—are irrational and founded in ignorance
and lack of understanding and skill. Fears, then, can be
combated by the building up of knowledge and skill in
adjusting to situations. They should always be brought out
into the open, and discussed, and the individual should be
helped to make an adjustment to the situation producing
the fear. Fear, you remember from our previous discussion,
results from the person's inability to adjust easily and
quickly to a situation that he has interpreted as being
dangerous to him in some way. Training in dealing with
fear can, therefore, take two forms in the development
of methods of dealing with potential fear situations, and
in the development of a better understanding of situations
so that situations will not be interpreted as dangerous when
they are not. Fears can be prevented best not by shielding the
child from all situations that might produce fear but by aiding
him to understand these situations and to adjust to them..
b. Dealing with anger in the child.
Anger explosions in the young child are to be expected.
When his environment restricts his activity, and when he
does not understand the necessity for such restrictions, or
when he fails to get his own way, anger may result. The
usual anger expression in the young child is the temper
tantrum―kicking, screaming, and an almost complete loss
of control. The main thing to be sure of here is that the
temper tantrum is not successful, that the child does not
influence other people to cater to his wants by this method.
This means that the most effective method is to remove
either the child's audience or the child himself. He soon
learns that he cannot succeed in that way and is helped to
discard this method of trying to produce results.
113.


## p. 114 (#130) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
When anger explosions are frequent in the child, it is
a good idea to examine his environment. It may be that
some of the people in his little world present this pattern of
behavior and that he is merely using the method employed
by his mother, his father, or his teacher. Also, there may be
so many restrictions that he is almost forced to explode in
order to feel at all free to express his own individuality. Or
he may merely be lacking in sufficient sleep; emotional con-
trol is difficult when one is fatigued. There are often under-
lying causes of the emotional explosion, which should be
ferreted out and dealt with. There is very little use,in dealing
directly with the temper tantrum itself by punishment or any
other such method.
The child, as he grows and develops, needs help in learn-
ing desirable emotional expression. That is, emotional educa-
tion gives training not merely in suppressing emotions, but
in adjusting to emotion-producing situations and in express-
ing the emotional condition in a socially acceptable manner.
•
3. EMOTIONAL ADJUSTMENT IN THE ADULT
There are a number of simple suggestions that may be
given to help the adult achieve an effective emotional con-
trol. The individual can reduce emotional disturbance by a
careful management of his environment so that he may avoid
situations that are emotion producing. This suggestion, how-
ever, can be carried too far, in that he may hinder his happi-
ness and efficiency by removing from his daily life all emer-
gency situations. On the other hand, there is little sense in
torturing oneself by exposure to too many situations that
have an emergency or danger quality. It is a dangerous game
to play when the individual continually gets himself un-
necessarily into situations that are fraught with danger. He
may get thrills out of narrow escapes, or thrills from fear-
producing movies or books, but these thrills may be experi-
enced at a serious cost to his emotional health.
Another simple suggestion for emotional control is to

Activity helps to prevent or dissipate an emotion. People are afraid during
an air raid; but when they have something to do, their fear is lessened.
remember that reason and emotion do not mix. This means
that by an emphasis on the rational and intelligent features
in any situation emotional disturbance may be avoided.
When the individual succeeds in "keeping his head" in any
situation he usually succeeds in preventing an emotional
disturbance.
Related to "keeping one's head" is the suggestion that
activity also helps to prevent or dissipate an emotion. The
best example we have of that at present is the situation in
the bombed areas of Great Britain. Of course, most people
in a raid were afraid, but those who had something to do and
did it were less affected by fear than were those who had
nothing to do. Activity, especially strenuous activity, pro-
vides an outlet for the emotional condition and tends to
115


## p. 116 (#132) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
drain the emotion off. This, in some simple situations, means
that if, when the individual feels fear or anger developing, he
can find something to do, the emotional disturbance will not
be so serious or so intense. This is even more effective when
the "something to do" is closely related to the emotion-
producing situation and forms an adjustment to it.
Another way of dissipating a developing emotional condi-
tion is to "laugh it off." Laughter is actually an emotional
outlet. The young child who explodes in gales of laughter
after being thrown into the air and caught, or after being
poked in the ribs, is using laughter in its primitive stage; but
the principle is the same in most laughter, and certainly the
individual who can manage a hearty laugh rarely goes on
from there into a state of fear or anger.
4. LACK OF CONFIDENCE AND FEAR OF BEING INFERIOR OR
INADEQUATE
A very common personal difficulty, and a most trouble-
some one, is lack of confidence in oneself. This takes many
forms, and is called by a variety of names. The most popular
term for it is inferiority complex. A careful
survey indicated
that about 75 per cent of adults have this condition in some
form or other. This lack of trust in oneself may be only in a
particular situation, or it may be a generalized feeling that is
present in all activity. It may be experienced in the realm of
knowledge or of learning or in terms of muscular activity of
various kinds or in skills and aptitudes or, even more fre-
quently, in social relationships.
In most cases this feeling of inadequacy has begun in
childhood, when the child was made to feel inferior because
of his lack of knowledge and experience, as well as of skills.
In some cases the feeling of general inferiority disappears
when the individual learns more and overcomes his ignorance
and inefficiency; but in other cases it continues, even though
the person has been successful in acquiring knowledge and
skills. The element of competition in education is responsible
116


## p. 117 (#133) ############################################

EMOTIONAL CONTROL
to a great extent for the prevalence of the inferiority feelings,
as only one in a class can come first, and all except the
winners are failures.
A number of simple suggestions may be offered as a remedy
for this lack of self-confidence. The first essential is that the
individual shall make a fair appraisal of himself. To do this
he needs to make an impersonal, objective inventory of his
strengths and weaknesses. He must be careful of the stand-
ards he uses in making this appraisal. The tendency is to
compare ourselves not with the average but with the best.
This, of course, is not being fair to ourselves, as it would be
very unlikely that anyone could be best in everything. He
can assess his strong points and remind himself of those
things that he can do better than the average person and
those areas of knowledge where he knows more than the
average. He can at the same time assess his weak points—
things that he cannot do so well as the average and areas of
knowledge in which he has little information. Some of these
lacks can be overcome by a carefully planned program of
learning. Others must be accepted as personal limitations
that are known and over which no time and energy should
be wasted in regret, because of the realization that everyone
has his limitations and that no one can be good in everything.
Often a lack of self-confidence is emphasized by the indi-
vidual's continually reminding himself of how deficient
he is. Such continual self-suggestion only serves to make any
individual less able to improve. He needs, therefore, to
adopt a new kind of suggestion-a suggestion that he has
some personal worth and can do some things well, and that
he can improve and intends to improve in some other fields
of endeavor. Many are held back from personal improvement
by the idea that they just cannot do or learn some things at
all. This may be an entirely false idea and, if anyone who has
it could only get rid of it, he might be able to improve
greatly.
Another valuable suggestion in removing inferiority feel-

ings is deliberately
to strengthen the
idea of success and
arrange conditions
so that it is possible
to taste the thrill of
accomplishment.
"Nothing succeeds
like success" means
that success once
experienced, even in
a small way, moti-
vates the individual
to seek further
successes in the same
field or in related
fields. It is relatively
easy to arrange for
success, if the in-
dividual will set for
himself a goal that is
possible of accom-
plishment.
A planned program for the development of special skills
in some line of endeavor should help the individual to
rid himself of his inhibiting feeling of inadequacy. That
is, practically everyone can find some activity in which he can
become proficient above the average. He can then feel that
there is something that he can do better than nearly everyone
else. It does not matter much what the activity is, as long
as the individual himself feels that it is something that is
worth doing.
And whole-body exercise helps the individual to build up
his self-confidence. There is a healthy outflow of energy in
exercise that employs most of the large muscles, and this
energy expression aids the person in relieving some pent-up

tensions, so that he comes away from the exercise with a
healthy mental glow that makes him forget for the time his
frustrations and failures. The person who can throw himself
wholeheartedly into such exercise as swimming, walking,
running, rowing, skating, skiing, or into playing tennis or
golf, basketball or badminton, or indeed into almost any
exercise that uses his large muscles, has an antidote for his
lack of self-confidence as well as a useful outlet for his
energies.
No one need allow his emotional life to stand in the way
of his happiness and efficiency. Emotions are subject to
change; they can be modified through practice. The main
thing is to know what your emotional habits are and then to
want to improve and to make a determined effort to practice
better emotional expression.

INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES AND THEIR
MEASUREMENT
This part of our study of human activity deals with the
fact of individual differences. People differ from each other
in nearly every aspect of their activity. We will concentrate
on two of the most important ways in which these differ-
ences are evident-intelligence and personality.
Some of the questions that will be answered are
What is intelligence?
How is intelligence measured?
Are intelligence tests necessary?
In what ways are the tests used?
What is personality?
How does personality develop?
How is personality measured?

INTELLIGENCE TESTS
TH
I. INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
HAT people differ is a fact so obvious that we often over-
look it. A few casual observations are sufficient to
demonstrate that there are great differences between indi-
viduals in every characteristic of activity. This obvious fact
has been neglected or denied many times in the history of
mankind. One outstanding example of the failure to realize
the presence of individual differences in activity happened in
the eighteenth century in an astronomical observatory in
England. The assistant recording the movement of a particu-
lar star was found to vary in his record from the man in
charge. The assistant was thought to have made an error
and was discharged. However, it was discovered later that all
observers differed slightly in exactness of records. This was
the beginning of the study of what came to be called the
personal equation in scientific observation and measurement.
It became the psychologist's task to study and measure the
personal equation. That individuals vary in all characteris-
tics of activity is now a well-established fact.
To indicate the range of individual differences in ability
let us look at two examples. John Stuart Mill was reading
Greek long before the usual age for a child to start school;
and, before he was old enough to vote, he had written several
very important books. Contrast with Mill's the case of J. B.,
who at the age of twenty-one could not calculate the cost
of three one-cent stamps and three two-cent stamps, with
the stamps before him. Although he had spent ten years in
school, he was unable to read anything but the very simplest
123

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
selections; he could not tell how many fingers he had on both
hands without counting them, and even then he would
probably make a mistake. These two examples represent
two extremes of ability, and, of course, between them there
are all degrees. The difference between individuals in regard
to what is usually called common sense, mental ability, and
character is enormous; and such differences are very im-
portant. What is opportunity to one man is discouragement
to another; and, while one is climbing the dizzy heights to
fame, the other is wending his weary way to the poorhouse.
The greatest and most common intelligence test is life
itself, a test that some pass with honors while others fail
miserably. For the most part, adult life does not create these
great differences between people. It merely emphasizes them,
for these differences exist in childhood, although, because of
the protective forces thrown around the child, they are
rarely noticed particularly at that time.
People differ in physical characteristics-weight, height,
shape of the face, color of the hair, and so on. Individuals also
differ greatly in their conscious life, in their forms of imagery,
methods of thought, habits of reasoning, and use of imagi-
nation. They vary in what they perceive in the same situ-
ation. They differ in the efficiency of their sense organs—one
person being color-blind, another shortsighted, another
stone-deaf, and so on. Great variations exist in the emotional
responses of people. While one person seldom becomes angry,
another may fly into a rage at the least provocation. One
person can learn three or four times as fast as another.
Individuals differ greatly in their ability to adjust or adapt
themselves to novel situations. Socially, mentally, emotion-
ally, morally people exhibit wide differences.
When we attempt to measure any of these individual
differences we usually find that there are no distinct cate-
gories in which to place individuals, but that rather there
is a continuous gradation of whatever characteristic we are
measuring from one extreme to another. Another common
124


## p. 125 (#141) ############################################

INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENCE TESTS
result of measurement of any characteristic of human
activity is that the great majority of people are found to be
in the middle part of the scale, and also that one extreme
tends to balance the other extreme. To put this in another
way, there are usually just about as many of those making
low scores as of those making high scores, but the majority
are near the average. In statistical terms the frequency dis-
tribution of such scores resembles a normal distribution.
People have always been interested in classifying others-
continually labeling them as dull or bright, able or the re-
verse, good or bad, good learners or poor learners, good or
not so good providers, and so on indefinitely. What psy-
chology has done in this field is to adopt the everyday
problem of everyday classification and measurement and
attempt to apply exact techniques of measurement and
interpretation. Of course, psychology still has much to do in
this regard, but attempts to classify people according to
ability and other characteristics of activity are gradually
becoming more exact and useful.
2. HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE TESTS
The history of the development of techniques for the
measurement of intelligence is a long and interesting story,
the mere outline of which can be given here.
In early times those who represented extreme diversions
from the normal in ability were recognized and labeled fools
or were thought to be possessed of devils. At one time, the
only treatment given to these individuals was by whips and
chains. In the nineteenth century, when a deeper sense of
social justice was born, such treatment was forever abolished.
When Seguin in France, who believed in the education of the
feeble-minded, succeeded in getting some others to believe
in it as well, the era of special classes and clinics to deal with
the subnormal in ability began. This interest in the feeble-
minded created a need for some accurate method of measur-
ing the ability of individuals.
125


## p. 126 (#142) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
Another line of development came through the laboratories
of experimental psychology. With the founding of Wundt's
laboratory in Germany a beginning was made in the attempts
to measure the activities of individuals. Cattell was a leader
in the movement in the United States. Darwin, Spencer, and
Galton in England were interested in problems of human
heredity and gave an impetus to studies on the measurement
of ability.
The child-study movement, with a long historical back-
ground in Europe, was initiated in America by G. S. Hall,
Kirkpatrick, and others. Again the necessity and desire to
measure ability became prominent.
Some of the earliest tests were tests of physical charac-
teristics, such as strength of grip, rate of movement, and so
on. Ebbinghaus in Germany was interested in the problems.
of memory and learning and invented ways of measuring
learning and forgetting.
The first real mental tests were probably used by Cattell
in 1890, but these tests were rather crude and inaccurate.
The Chicago World's Fair in 1893 witnessed Jastrow at-
tempting to measure the intelligence of any who were
interested.
Statistical methods, which were destined to play a large
part in later research in this field, were invented by Spear-
man and others in England.
Perhaps the most important single development came from
France in the work of one of the leading psychologists of that
country, A. Binet. An educational commission to study ways
and means of dealing with the children who fell behind in
their schoolwork called in Binet and other psychologists.
Binet conceived this problem to be one that called for the
measurement of ability in order to determine whether the
retardation in schoolwork of these students was due to a
lack of native ability or to some other cause. He tried out a
variety of possible ways of measuring intelligence and
finally decided that the most accurate method would be to
126


## p. 127 (#143) ############################################

INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENCE TESTS
select a large number of little tasks and determine which of
these could be passed by children of different age groups.
Binet's first scale of tests, which appeared in 1905, consisted
of thirty small tests arranged in order of difficulty. In 1908
the second scale appeared. In this scale Binet arranged the
tests in age groups, and the concept of mental age was
adopted. The mental-age method of measurement is based
on the idea that there are certain things that an average
child of a given age can be expected to do, so that any individ-
ual can be said to have the mental age corresponding to the
problems that he can solve. The year of Binet's last revision,
1911, was also the year of his death. His work rapidly became
known all over the world.
American workers soon translated and revised the scales
for use in this country. Goddard produced the first of these
scales in 1910. Another revision was made by Herring; but
the Stanford revision of the Binet test, made by Terman of
Stanford University in 1916, has had the widest use. This is
a very valuable test, which has been made even more effi-
cient by a further revision brought out in 1937.
The next step in the development of intelligence testing
came in the introduction of group methods of testing. During
the First World War, the United States Army testing pro-
gram was responsible for the production in great numbers of
tests suitable for the testing of large groups of individuals
at the same time. These group tests of intelligence were great
timesavers and made it possible for the army testers to
measure the intelligence of several millions of men in the
United States Army. In the Second World War, intelligence
tests have been used for most of the armed forces of the
world as an aid in selecting men and sorting them into
the types of unit in which they could make the greatest
contribution.
Another development was the introduction of tests that
could be used for subjects who had some language difficulty
or who were illiterate. These tests made use of concrete
•127


## p. 128 (#144) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
materials and were called performance tests. Many varieties
of performance tests have been devised and have proved a
very useful supplement to the usual verbal intelligence tests.
The success of intelligence tests led to the extension of
testing techniques to the measurement of other characteris-
tics of the individual. Tests for vocational aptitude were
invented. Achievement tests of various kinds were brought
out, and finally tests designed to measure personality charac-
teristics were tried.
3. ARE INTELLIGENCE TESTS SUPERFLUOUS?
It has been suggested by some that intelligence tests are
unnecessary, that anyone can tell whether an individual is
feeble-minded or normal or bright. This is true to a certain
extent, but there is often a need for something more than
a rough estimate of ability. Judgments about a person's
intelligence are subject to large and serious errors and are
often clouded by such factors as likes, dislikes, bias, and
prejudice.
If a set of photographs of children ranging in intelligence
from feeble-minded to very bright were given to a group of
individuals to be ranked in order of intelligence, the resulting
judgments would be about as correct as they would be if the
judges ranked the children by drawing lots.
If the same judges were given the opportunity of seeing
the same children lined up in a room and made their judg-
ments from this chance to observe the subjects, the judg-
ments would be slightly better, but still not very accurate.
If the judges were allowed to interview the children
separately for a period and ask them any questions that
they wished, the accuracy of their judgments would be in-
creased. If these judges had the opportunity of having
the children together daily in a classroom for 6 months, the
estimates of ability would be still more accurate. If the
judges were given a set of standard tests and were told what
the average child of each age could be expected to do on these
128


## p. 129 (#145) ############################################

INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENCE TESTS
tests, the accuracy of the estimates would be increased
greatly. This is what intelligence tests aim to do-to give a
means of comparing the individual's performance with that
of the average or normal child of a given age.
Tests also make it possible to make the judgment or
estimate of intelligence quantitative. In any measure-
ment there is the necessity for some standard of compari-
son. Almost anyone can tell that a 10-foot table is longer
than a 3-foot table; but when it comes to finer judgments,
some standard of measurement is necessary, such as a yard-
stick, in order that the judgment may be accurate and
reliable. This is equally true in the measurement of ability.
Although it may be possible for nearly everyone to tell
that one child is brighter than another, there are occasions
when it is necessary to make more accurate comparisons,
and for this purpose the intelligence test serves as a measuring
stick.
The intelligence of retarded children is usually judged
to be more than it actually is, because we usually compare
that child with the younger children in the same grade,
so that an eleven-year-old child may be judged by a seven-
year-old standard. The intelligence of superior children is
usually underestimated because of the same factor—that of
judging them not by the actual age standards but by those
of other children belonging to the same grade in school.
It is difficult without tests to distinguish genuine dullness
from the mental condition that results from an unfavorable
and unstimulating environment. Speech difficulties and other
special disabilities often becloud the issue. There is usually
a tendency to overestimate the talkative child and to under-
estimate the quiet, shy individual. These are some of the
reasons why intelligence tests are necessary in order that
an accurate and reliable estimate of ability may be obtained.
Schoolteachers make use of many different methods of
judging intelligence. Success in school examinations, ability
to read, knowledge of facts of geography and history, ability
to memorize, resourcefulness in play, capacity to adjust to

new situations, manners, general appearance including shape
of the head and expression of the face, tidiness, and many
other capacities and characteristics have been used. Most
people have very little idea as to what intelligence is, but
the majority have confidence in their own ability to size up
others. The members of mankind have a perennial interest
in their own capacities, an interest that has donated millions
of dollars to such quackeries and pseudo sciences as phrenol-
ogy, fortunetelling, palmistry, graphology, and hosts of
others. Intelligence tests are not magic, they are carefully
constructed measuring sticks; nor do intelligence tests tell
all there is to know about anyone. In order to help an
individual, the psychologist needs to know something about

his intelligence, but this knowledge is only one small part
of the total picture. The giving of an intelligence test does
not imply a suspicion of feeble-mindedness, as some seem to
think; but an intelligence-test score is significant, whether
it be high or low or average.
4. INTELLIGENCE DEFINED
There are almost as many definitions of intelligence as
there are writers on the subject. The difference between
these writers is more apparent than real. Binet said that
intelligence is the ability to take and maintain a mental
set, the capacity to make adjustments for the purpose of
attaining a desired end, and the power of self-criticism.
This is one of the most comprehensive definitions given
and is probably as good as any.
Other definitions may be mentioned briefly. Woodworth
defines intelligence as seeing the point, adapting oneself to
novel situations, and retentiveness. Dearborn says that
intelligence is the capacity to learn or to profit by experience.
Terman describes intelligence as the ability to carry on ab-
stract thinking.
These are a few of the many definitions of intelligence
that psychologists have formulated. Whether they define
intelligence as the ability to adjust or the capacity to learn
or the plasticity of the nervous system, all psychologists
agree that intelligence is measured by intelligence tests.
5. HOW INTELLIGENCE IS MEASURED
Intelligence is measured through the performance of
the individual in a set of definite standardized problems
in restricted and controlled conditions. The performance
is measured and compared with the average performance of a
large number of individuals of the same age. The result may
be stated in terms of the mental age, the intelligence quotient,
the percentile rank, or some similar measure.
The mental age is an expression of the extent of develop-
131


## p. 132 (#148) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
ment achieved by the individual stated in terms of the
performance that can be expected at any given age. When
a person is said to have a mental age of ten years, his per-
formance on the tests corresponds to that of the average
ten-year-old child.
The intelligence quotient is an expression of the rate
of mental development and is found by dividing the mental
age of the individual by his actual chronological age, and
multiplying the result by 100 to remove fractions. If an
individual's performance was exactly average, his I.Q.
would be 100, if less than average below 100, and if above the
average over 100.
The percentile ranking states the rank of the individual
in the general population in terms of per cent. A percentile
ranking of 50 would mean that there would be as many
people with higher scores than this individual as there
were with lower scores, and a percentile ranking of 75 would
mean that there would be approximately 75 per cent with
lower scores and 25 per cent with higher scores.
There are many kinds of intelligence tests, but all are
based on the same general principle that of selected
problem situations and the comparison of the individual's
performance, when faced with these problems, with the
average performance. The following classification indicates
the kinds of intelligence tests in use:
A. Individual tests in which the subject is tested separately.
1. Verbal or question-and-answer tests.
a. Age scales, in which the tests are arranged in age
levels.
b. Point scales, in which definite points are given for
each performance.
2. Performance tests in which the subject is required to
handle concrete materials. These may be either age or
point scales.
a. Maze tests.
b. Picture-completion tests.
c. Form boards.
132


## p. 133 (#149) ############################################

INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENCE TESTS
B. Group tests in which a number of individuals are tested
together.
1. Verbal-pencil-and-paper tests.
2. Performance tests.
Let us look in more detail at one of these tests and see
how it is used. The test that has been used most in America
is the Stanford revision of the Binet scale called the Stanford-
Binet intelligence test. Let us suppose that we want to test
a boy eight years of age. The first essential is that the
person
who is to do the testing shall be trained in the testing
technique. The boy is taken into a room alone with the tester,
and some time is spent in making him feel at home and in
removing all nervousness and strangeness. When the tester
is sure that the boy is interested and will do his best, the
actual test begins. As we have already noted, the test con-
sists of a number of tests at each age level. The test in this
case would be started at the six-year-old level. There are
six tests at this age; they are, briefly, distinguishing the left
from the right, finding omissions in pictures, counting thir-
teen pennies, comprehension or what's the thing to do in
several practical situations, naming five coins, and repeating
sentences after the examiner. Each of these separate tests
is scored as passed or failed.
In this case we will suppose that the boy has passed all the
tests; so, we may go on to the next age level, age seven. The
six tests at this age level are as follows: giving the number
of fingers on both hands; describing pictures; repeating
five digits after hearing them once; tying a bowknot from a
sample; giving differences between such things as a fly and
a butterfly, a stone and an egg; and copying a diamond.
Very definite standards for scoring each attempt are given
by the author of the test.
Let us suppose that our subject has been able to pass
successfully all but one of the tests given; we then go on
to the next age level, age eight. The six tests at this level
are as follows: the ball and field test, in which the subject
133


## p. 134 (#150) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
draws a line to mark out his path in looking for a ball lost
in a circular field; counting backward from 20 to 1; compre-
hension or what's the thing to do; giving similarities between
such things as wood and coal; giving definitions for such
words as balloon and football; and a vocabulary test.
Supposing that the boy passed only two of these tests,
we will go on to the next age level. The tests for age nine
are giving the date, arranging five weights in order of heavi-
ness, making change in practical situations, repeating four
digits backward, using three words in a sentence, and finding
rhymes for words. Our subject has failed on all these tests,
so our testing is finished.
Notice the procedure, starting the test at an age level
at which we are fairly sure that our subject will pass all
the tests, continuing through the succeeding age levels
until we come to one where all the tests are failed. Each
test is scored as passed or failed, according to definite
standards. The scoring of this test would be as follows:
The base age is the age level at which all tests are passed,
in this case six years. Each test has a value in terms of
months, and in our example the boy gets credit for passing
five tests at the seven-year level, a total of 10 months;
two tests at the eight-year level, a total of 4 months; and no
credit at the nine-year level. The mental age is found by add-
ing the base age and the months' credit earned, in this case a
total of seven years and two months. This total represents
the mental age of the boy. The intelligence quotient is calcul-
ated from the mental age and the chronological age as follows:
I.Q.
=
M.A.
86 months
C.A.
X 100
or
I.Q.
=
X 100 =
96 months
89.6 or 90
The number of tests and the credit in months for each in
the 1916 Stanford-Binet test is as follows: Yr. III, IV, V,
134


## p. 135 (#151) ############################################

INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENCE TESTS
VI, VII, VIII, IX, X,-six tests in each with a credit of 2
months each; Yr. XII-eight tests with 3 months' credit each;
Yr. XIV-six tests with 4 months' credit each; Yr. XVI,
or average adult-six tests, 5 months' credit each; and
superior adult with six tests and 6 months' credit each.
In calculating the I.Q. of any individual whose chrono-
logical age is over sixteen, the mental age obtained on the
test is divided by 16, no matter how much older the in-
dividual is.
This is what is called an age scale, where the tests are
arranged according to age levels on the basis of the per-
formance of a large number of cases, and credit is given in
terms of units of mental age. Another method of scoring
tests is the point-scale method, where a certain number of
points is given for passing each individual test in the scale
and the mental age is determined by a comparison of the
individual's score with a set of norms or averages of the
scores of a large number of cases at each age level.
.
The group tests were invented as timesavers. To test
a large number of cases by the individual method would
require considerable time, whereas by the group-testing
method a large number of cases can be tested at one time.
In making a survey of a school or any other group, it is
valuable to give group tests and then select from the results
of this test those cases, either high or low, which require
further study and give them individual tests. Group tests
are of necessity written tests, the instructions being in
some cases given orally and in other cases read by the
subject himself in the test booklet.
The Army Alpha group test, given to some millions of
men in the United States Army, has been the model for
many other group tests constructed since that time. This
test consists of eight small tests, each one of which in turn
consists of many smaller units. The eight tests are as follows:
(a) a directions test in which the subject follows complicated
oral directions in marking figures; (b) a series of arithmetic

the test measures both speed of performance and accuracy
of comprehension.
Performance tests of various kinds were invented as a
supplement to the verbal tests and also as a means of testing
persons who have difficulty with language, such as foreigners,
persons with speech or reading defects, illiterates, and so
on. A great variety of materials have been used, but the
principle is the same in all-to provide a problem, to record

and to compare this with the average performance of a

6. RESULTS FROM THE USE OF INTELLIGENCE TESTS
a. Distribution of intelligence in the population.
From the results of tests given to many thousands of
persons the following distribution is thought to be repre-
sentative of the general population:
Per Cent of the
Population
I.Q. below 70- I
I.Q. 70- 79— 5
I.Q. 80 89-14
I.Q. 90- 99—30
I.Q. 100- 109—30
I.Q. 110- 119—14
I.Q. 120- 129— 5
I.Q. over 129— I
About 60 per cent of the total population have an intelli-
gence quotient between 90 and 110, while 20 per cent are
below 90 and 20 per cent about 110. Another way of indicat-
ing the significance of the intelligence quotient is to give
descriptive terms to definite I.Q. ranges as follows:
I.Q. o 25-idiot
I.Q. 25- 50 imbecile
I.Q.
I.Q.
I.Q.
I.Q.
50-70-moron
70- 80-borderline
80-90-dull
90-110 average or normal
I.Q. 110-120-superior
I.Q. 120-140 very superior
I.Q. over 140 genius
Idiots, imbeciles, and morons are usually called mental
defectives or feeble-minded. These descriptive terms
terms are
at best only a very rough means of classification. There
are no definite boundaries between the different classes.
For instance, an imbecile with an I.Q. of 49 is not significantly
different from a moron with an I.Q. of 51; in fact, in a retest
their positions may be reversed.

The curve showing distribution of intelligence in the general population.
indicates that 60 per cent of the people have an I.Q. of 90-110. The other
40 per cent divides itself equally into 20 per cent below and 20 per cent
above this I.Q. Note how similar the percentages are as the curve declines
on both sides for greater and less intelligence among the remaining 40
per cent.
b. Constancy of the 1.2.
If a child is tested at the age of five can the result be
taken as a safe prediction of that child's intelligence at
the age of sixteen? A person's I.Q. may rise or decline as he
grows older, but only to a surprisingly slight extent. In
general, the I.Q. remains at about the same level through-
out life, so that a fairly safe prediction can be made re-
garding the future intelligence of an individual from a
test. Retests of hundreds of children show on the average
a change from the first I.Q. of about five points up or down,
while a change of ten points or more in an I.Q. is an exception
and is found very infrequently. There are definite and per-
manent rises in the I.Q. of individuals who have been
relieved from a physical handicap, such as deafness or blind-
ness. A radical change in environmental conditions may
cause a very slight permanent change in the I Q.
c The growth of intelligence.
Although the intelligence quotient remains fairly con-
stant, there is a continual growth in mental age from birth
up to the teens. It is difficult to say just how long this
growth in intelligence continues. It is very difficult to obtain
samples of the population after the age of fourteen, because
139


## p. 140 (#156) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
children are then beginning to leave school. For this reason,
it is difficult to tell definitely when growth stops. The average
of all the scores on the army tests in the United States was
less than a mental age of fourteen. However, it seems from
studies of development that intelligence does grow beyond
the age of fourteen and probably up to sixteen or eighteen.
In the Stanford-Binet test, the assumption is made that
growth is complete at the age of sixteen, because in the
calculation of the I.Q. for subjects over that age the chrono-
logical age of sixteen is used, no matter how old the individual
may be. Does this mean that the individual does not improve
intellectually beyond the age of sixteen? Of course not;
the individual may continue to develop for ten, twenty,
or thirty years; but what it does mean is that the ability to
solve novel problems is as good at sixteen as it is at forty.
The individual may go on learning, acquiring knowledge and
skills, and thus developing mentally; but his ability to
comprehend and solve new problems has reached its maxi-
mum at about the age of sixteen.
d. Is intelligence inherited?
It has been fairly well proved by different methods that
general ability or intelligence is inherited. The environment
may or may not create opportunities for the normal develop-
ment of this native power; but no environment can create
an ability that is not already possessed by the individual.
The children of feeble-minded parents are almost sure to be
feeble-minded, and the children of superior parents are
more than likely to be bright-witted. Although the inherit-
ance of intelligence has not been proved absolutely, all
indications seem to point in that direction.
e. The relation of intelligence and success in life.
Although there is no guarantee that a high intelligence
will bring success to its possessor, it certainly is one factor
contributing to such success as is attained. The school
140


## p. 141 (#157) ############################################

INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENCE TESTS
child may not be successful in his schoolwork and still may
have a normal or above-normal intelligence. There are other
factors besides intelligence involved in success in life situa-
tions. Motivation and persistence are two of these factors
that contribute to success or failure. However, the individual
with a high intelligence quotient has a greater chance of
success than has the one with an I.Q. below normal. It has
been shown by actual study that the average intelligence of
people in different occupations differs. For instance, the
average intelligence of the professional man is higher than
the average intelligence of the mechanic or office clerk.
Of course, there are wide variations within each occupation.
It can be said that any occupation requires a certain degree
of intelligence. A great amount of work still remains to be
done, however, before we can determine definitely just what
degree of intelligence is required for each occupation. While
intelligence is closely related to success in life, it is not the
only factor that determines success.
7. USES OF INTELLIGENCE TESTS
Intelligence, as measured by intelligence tests, is obviously
an asset in most lines of endeavor. There is a fairly close
relationship between the ability of an individual as indicated
by the tests and the success of the individual in life situations,
but this relationship is not by any means perfect.
In some situations a high intelligence is a handicap, as
in the case of the child whose intelligence is such that he
can do all the schoolwork expected of him in half the time
required by the rest of the class and who thus has plenty of
time for getting into mischief and is likely to lose interest
in the schoolwork.
The man in an occupation that does not require very much
intelligence to carry on may become bored, restless, and
dissatisfied. It never pays to put very intelligent individuals
into dull, monotonous, routine jobs, because such workers
do not stay very long at such tasks and may not even do
141


## p. 142 (#158) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
them well. On the other hand, the individual whose intelli-
gence is not sufficient to carry on in a particular position
may become humiliated by constant failure, may grow
sullen and rebellious, and may project his trouble on his
employer or on the social system.
The dull boy at school who has been placed in a grade too
high for him, because of his size or because of the fact that
his former teacher was glad to get rid of him, finds it much
more pleasant out of school than in and may soon acquire
the truancy habit and drift into other delinquencies. It
was not low intelligence that drove him into crime but low
intelligence coupled with a social system that demanded
from him more than he could give, and thus made things too
unpleasant for him in the "straight and narrow path."
We might multiply examples to show that intelligence has
much to do with success or failure in making adjustment to
life situations, and, in fact, in every department of human
activity. It might be of greater value, however, to indicate
briefly the major uses to which intelligence tests have been
put and some of the important resultant conclusions.
a. The feeble-minded.
The testing movement had its beginning very close to
the problem of the feeble-minded. It is natural, therefore,
that the testing program should have a very special applica-
tion to the feeble-minded section of the population. It was
thought at one time that the feeble-minded person was
very different from the normal individual, that he was a
being apart, radically different from the rest of us. One
thing that the testing program has indicated clearly is that
there are not separate and distinct classes of individuals,
but rather that all such classes shade into each other in an
imperceptible way. An imbecile is not an individual who is
radically different from others, but rather a human being
very similar to all other human beings, differing only in the
degree of ability to adjust to complex situations.
142


## p. 143 (#159) ############################################

INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENCE TESTS
The feeble-minded individual requires different treat-
ment from that given to others. He is unable to adjust
adequately to the complexities of social and vocational
activities. He requires a different kind of education from the
average. This being the case, it is rather essential that such
individuals be discovered early in life. This is possible only
by means of tests. Intelligence tests make it possible to give
a very precise and definite meaning to the term mental
deficiency, leaving no room for difference of opinion, personal
bias, or prejudice. The usual procedure now is to consider a
person with an I.Q. below 70 to be feeble-minded, requiring
special training. With the proper use of intelligence tests,
feeble-minded individuals can be discovered early in life,
and much waste and inefficiency can be prevented. A con-
servative estimate of the number of feeble-minded in the
population is I per cent. Feeble-mindedness is a rather im-
portant social problem, which has not as yet received the
attention that it warrants.
b. In delinquency.
Another social problem, to which intelligence testing may
be of real assistance is that of the child delinquent. The
tendency today in dealing with the child "criminal" is to
make a careful study of the child who has been discovered
breaking the laws and to attempt to find the cause of the
difficulty. The child is not considered a wrongdoer so much
as one who is poorly adjusted to life. Intelligence tests aid
in this study.
From a large mass of statistics it has been shown that there
is a much larger percentage of feeble-mindedness and below-
the-average intelligence among the delinquents than among
the total population. We may conclude from this that
delinquency and low intelligence are in some way related.
A typical study of juvenile delinquents by C. Burt may be
taken as characteristic of a large number of such studies.
He found that, in a group of 107 delinquents between the
143


## p. 144 (#160) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
ages of six and fifteen, the average chronological age was
13.2 and the average mental age was 11.3, indicating an
average retardation in intelligence of about two years.
Seven per cent were definitely feeble-minded, 20 per cent
were dull, 44 per cent were less dull but still below the
normal, 27 per cent were about average, and only 2 per cent
were slightly above the average in intelligence.
Delinquents of high mentality are rare, contrary to the
popular belief that it is necessary to be clever to be a crook.
The juvenile delinquent is typically a dull child; but, of
course, not all dull children are delinquent, nor are all
delinquents dull. Intelligence testing, although it does not
tell the whole story, is making a real contribution to the
problem of the delinquent child.
Persons with an intelligence below the normal are more
likely to get into trouble than are brighter individuals.
Society has failed, up to the present time, to make adequate
provision for these individuals. It is not low intelligence
alone that causes young people to get into trouble, but
low intelligence coupled with inadequate educational and
recreational facilities to care for them. Low intelligence is
a handicap in complex social situations and such individuals
need a great amount of help in solving their problems. Poor
emotional adjustment and poor treatment and discipline
in the home are also contributing factors to delinquency,
especially when they are combined with low intelligence.
Adult delinquency presents much the same problems as
juvenile delinquency, but we are much slower in adopting
scientific methods in the treatment of such cases. In a survey
of the people in a number of large prisons in the United
States it was found that about a quarter of the inmates
were definitely feeble-minded. Perhaps some day in the
future we shall really come to grips with this important
social problem and the criminal will be treated as a mentally
sick person. When this happens, intelligence tests will play
their part in the discovery of the causes of crime
144

INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENCE TESTS
c. In the educational system.
It is natural that one of the most important uses of in-
telligence tests is in the schools. There are a number of
reasons why it is necessary to classify students according to
ability. A very worth-while beginning has been made in
giving differential treatment to the dull child in school.
Intelligence tests are necessary in order to determine
whether lack of progress in schoolwork is due to a lack of
ability or to some other reason, and to detect the child
with a low intelligence early, before he has wasted much time
and effort in a vain attempt to carry on with the ordinary
school routine.
There are as many children above the average in intelli-
gence as there are below the average. This group has not yet
received the attention that has been given to the training
of the dull child. There is great waste in our present-day
educational systems. The superior individual lacks oppor-
tunities and direction for proper development. Just as the
subnormal child has been cared for in special classes and
curricula, so some special treatment is needed for the
superior child, as well. We have seen that lack of intelligence
may be conducive to delinquency and poor social adjust-
ment. Likewise, the bright child whose progress in school
must keep pace with that of the slower pupils may present
a problem. A boy with an I.Q. over 130 was brought to a
juvenile court with a long list of housebreaking and robbery
charges against his name. This boy was able to do the re-
quired schoolwork in about half the time needed by the other
pupils, and, as a result, he had plenty of spare time. All
might have been well but for the fact that his mother felt
that he should not take part in the usual activities of the
boys of the district, and he was not allowed to belong to
any clubs or teams. With plenty of spare time and nothing
to employ it, and with the stimulus of enthralling detective
stories, the boy was soon launched on a very real criminal
career.

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
The so-called problem case in the school requires a very
thorough study. Intelligence tests serve as one part of such
surveys. In fact, for the proper treatment of the school
child, intelligence tests are indispensable and should be a
routine matter in all schools.
Educational guidance is possible only if there is accurate
measurement of the ability of the child. The intelligence-
test score serves as a basis for the estimation of the kind
and amount of work that the child can be expected to do.
Intelligence-test scores would assist in deciding just how
long it would be worth while' for a child to continue his
educational career. Suitable courses of study can be selected
by means of a careful measurement of the ability and apti-
tudes of the child. In the higher forms of education, tests
may be valuable in the selection and elimination of candi-
dates for university and college courses.
d. For vocational guidance.
Educational guidance is a part of the larger problem of
vocational guidance. Vocational guidance is the attempt to
direct individuals into the types of occupation in which
they will be most likely to be successful. This implies a
knowledge of vocations and the degree of ability required
for these vocations. Our knowledge of the level of intelli-
gence required for each occupation is very incomplete as
yet. When we do know definitely the degree of intelligence
required for success in various occupations, we shall be able
to direct individuals into the lines of endeavor in which they
will have the greatest chance of success. Vocational guidance
is much broader than mere intelligence testing, but intelli-
gence testing can be of real assistance in such a program.
e. For special groups.
Intelligence tests are useful in making surveys of special
groups of persons, such as the deaf, the blind, the immigrant,
and racial groups. The results of testing a large number of

deaf and blind individuals with special tests indicates that
such sensory deficiencies reduce the average level of intelli-
gence. The blind and the deaf are characteristically less
intelligent than are the normal. In countries such as Canada
and the United States, where immigration is fairly continu-
ous, the use of intelligence tests to select those individuals
who will have a greater chance of success in the new land
seems to be the sensible procedure.
f. In industry.
Tests sometimes intelligence tests and sometimes other
tests comparable to intelligence tests-have been used as a
help in the selection of individuals for particular positions.
The usual method is to try out the test on persons already
engaged in the job.. If the test differentiates between the
successful and the less successful, it can be used in selecting
other individuals for the same task. Tests are very useful
here, not as the sole basis of selection, but as a very useful
supplement to other methods, such as the interview and the
application form, on which data on previous experience
and education and other matters have been gathered.
We have now indicated some of the major uses of intelli-
gence tests. The list is not by any means complete, for these
tests can be used in any situation in which it is necessary to
obtain some definite measurement of capacity. There are a
number of precautions that should be mentioned for the use
of intelligence tests. Intelligence tests should be administered
by those who have been trained in their use. Care should be
exercised in the interpretation of a test result. Tests are by
no means perfect and test scores are therefore not to be
considered as absolutely reliable, although they may be
considered as a much more accurate measure of ability than
any other method yet invented. We should not expect a test
to tell us all there is to know about the individual. Intelli-
gence tests have their limits of usefulness. There is far more
that we need to know about the individual besides his I.Q,

ways
and
HE term personality is used in a number of
is often given a rather indefinite meaning. However,
psychologists have narrowed these definitions down to
two: (a) the effect that the individual has on other people
and (b) the total pattern of habits of thinking, feeling,
and action, including attitudes, interests, likes and dis-
likes, aptitudes, and abilities. The latter use of the term
is adopted in our discussion. Personality, according to
this definition, is a rather inclusive term, taking in the
total make-up of the individual at any time, and is more-
over far from static or fixed. In fact, we think of personality
as being subject to change and improvement.
2. THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONALITY
To understand the personality of an individual, it is
necessary to study "how he got that way." As personality
is not fixed and permanent, it follows that heredity plays
a small part in its development. It is rather the day-by-day
experiences of the individual, the kinds of environment in
which he has developed, and the opportunities for all kinds of
learning that have made him what he is today. We will describe
four main types of influence that may have their effect in
shaping the personality of the individual in development.
They are physique, chemique, social factors, and learning.
a. Physique.
Although physique appearance, strength, body build,
size and proportion-has no value as a clear indication of
151


## p. 152 (#168) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
what the individual's personality is, it may have an indirect
effect on the development of his personality. For instance,
a boy who is small for his age and who has been subjected
to daily suggestions that he should eat more in order to
grow up into a “big, strong man like Daddy" may begin to
place an inordinate emphasis on size and physical strength
and, because he is smaller than others, may feel that there
is something wrong with him, that he is different or inferior.
Because he thinks this of himself, he may develop attitudes
and compensations that will make him a different kind of
person than he might otherwise have been. A girl who has
not fair, curly hair, but who sees adults making a great fuss.
over girls who have, may also wonder if anyone can like her
with her straight, dark hair. Any deviation in size, strength,
shape, appearance, etc., may lead the individual to have dis-
torted ideas of his effect on other people and thus develop
personality characteristics as the result of what he thinks
other people think of him. So, physique has its indirect
effect on personality development, even though there is no
direct relationship between any physical characteristics and
personality make-up.
b. Chemique.
By "chemique" we mean mainly the possible effect of
the endocrine glands on personality development. In the
main, it would appear that as long as these glands are
functioning normally their effect on personality is slight.
However, when any one of the glands fails to function
in a normal manner, it may have an indirect effect on be-
havior and personality. The thyroid glands have an effect
on the metabolism of the body. When they produce an over-
secretion, there is a tendency for the individual to be irritable,
restless, and "on edge." In case of insufficient secretion,
there is a tendency for the individual to be slow, "lazy,"
and sleepy. The pituitary glands are intimately related to
body growth, and malfunctioning of the glands may produce
152


## p. 153 (#169) ############################################

PERSONALITY AND ITS MEASUREMENT
excessive growth. The adrenal glands are related to the
emotional behavior of the individual. The gonads produce,
through their secretions, the secondary sexual character-
istics. Much still needs to be discovered about the effects
of these and other endocrine glands on behavior and per-
sonality, but at present it seems safe to say that their effect
is probably slight, except when there is some glandular
imbalance or when some gland is over- or underfunctioning.
c. Social factors.
Too much stress on the importance of the social factors
in personality development is impossible. The individual
has the personality he possesses mainly because of the
kind of social environment and social experiences he has
had during his development. The kind of family in which
he grew up, the teachers in the schools he attended, the
people in his community, his playmates, and indeed all
people with whom he came in contact have left their imprint
on him. He has been striving for a "place in the sun," for
social security, for a feeling of belonging, for status; and the
form that this striving has taken and the success or failure
of his attempts, all have their effect on his developing per-
sonality. Some social contacts are, of course, more important
for personality development than are others. The intimate
and continuous contacts with members of his immediate
family usually have the greatest effect. However, the nature
of the play gang, the type of teachers he has had, and any
dramatic social contacts are also very important.
d. Learning.
No situation can be overlooked in an attempt to account
for the personality development of the individual. In fact,
every experience that he has leaves him a slightly different
person. Some experiences have an effect that must be con-
sidered more than slight. Human beings are by nature
learning organisms-that is, they are changed or modified.
153


## p. 154 (#170) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
because of the experiences they have. In some cases, a book,
a casual comment, a motion picture, or indeed almost any
kind of experience can be the turning point in development,
starting a train of thought and action that may have far-
reaching effects on the personality development of the
individual.
3. CAN PERSONALITY BE MEASURED?
One of the most persistent attempts of man has been
to understand his own character and personality and the
characters and personalities of others. For centuries men have
been trying to solve the riddle of character reading and
prediction. Fortunetelling in all its many phases is always
prevalent. In this so-called enlightened age, millions of dollars
are spent every year to have the future read. Systems of
phrenology, physiognomy, graphology, palmistry, and so
on, never fail to sell. However bizarre, illogical, or impossible
the system of character reading may be, there are always
those who are ready to believe in it, even to the extent of
paying money to have someone tell them what they already
know.
Attempts at fortunetelling and fortune prediction have
been many and varied from very early times. Magic, in-
cantation, ritual, and sacrifice were all used in order to
produce a beneficent future. Curses, petitions, the wearing
of charms, and all kinds of ceremonials were supposed to
influence personal fortune and character. All this is not
past history, by any means, for many remnants of this
primitive magic and superstition persist today.
An advance was made from this early stage when man
recognized that physical events and personal characteris-
tics followed laws that are beyond the power of personal
desire and magical rites. Instead of trying to produce
changes in events and personality by ceremonials, men
attempted to discover signs and clues that would tell
what the fortune of the individual was likely to be. Astrology,

individual. Such factors are not only useless but misleading,
and one cannot be too emphatic in denouncing systems of
this sort. Our everyday conversation is full of examples of
the persistence of superstitions and beliefs that are supposed
to influence the course of human lives and help in the
discovery of the proper course of action.
155


## p. 156 (#172) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
As knowledge develops, we are slowly moving toward
another stage. We are gradually coming to realize that
these early methods are of little or no value and so we
are beginning to study the actual behavior of the indi-
vidual and attempting to apply measuring techniques to
the complicated activity of the individual.
It is easy to describe individuals. We look at a child
in school and say that his hands are dirty or clean, that his
clothes are tidy or untidy, that he is neat, or slow, or honest;
but such description has very little value. In order to be
of real significance, description should have a standard or
norm. A child whom we would call slow in comparison with
some other children might be fast in comparison with still
others, and a worker who is industrious when compared with
one group would be considered lazy or indolent when com-
pared with others. Any description of an individual, to be
useful, must not be limited to single events or occasions.
It is impossible to judge the skill and efficiency of a salesman
by the results of one sales interview, in which he may or
may not have been successful. In order to pick out a satis-
factory employee, a good wife, a mayor, or any individual
for a particular position, it is necessary to know something
about the more or less permanent tendencies, habits of
thought, feeling, and action that characterize him or her.
Measurement is one kind of description. When we measure
we describe, but the description is always in terms of some
standard of comparison and usually in numerical terms;
that is, the description is in terms of degrees of more or less.
Measurements are always of some part of the whole, never
the total. The measurements of a table tell only part of the
story of the table. We may go on measuring the table in
many ways—its length, width, thickness, height, hardness,
weight, smoothness, and so on, almost indefinitely. This is
true when we come to measure the infinitely more complex
thing that we call human personality. No one measurement
can be sufficient to give a complete picture.
156


## p. 157 (#173) ############################################

PERSONALITY AND ITS MEASUREMENT
We are continually passing judgments about others.
These judgments are usually in terms of extremes. We
label individuals as honest or dishonest, but it is just as
incorrect to use such labels as it is to describe all tables
as either large or small. In other words, personality char-
acteristics are matters of degree and amount, just the
same as the size of a table is. Just as there is a continuous
scale of intelligence and an individual may be placed any-
where along that scale, so with such personality charac-
teristics as honesty and industry, there are degrees, and
an individual may be placed anywhere along an honesty
scale, from absolute honesty to absolute dishonesty. The
crudest form of description here would be, then, to describe
an individual as either honest or dishonest, while a finer
scale would include such terms as never honest, seldom
honest, sometimes honest, usually honest, always honest.
A still finer measurement scale would give some numerical
value, such as honest in ten out of fifteen sample cases.
The measurement of personality characteristics is still
to a considerable extent in an experimental stage, although
rapid progress has been made during the last decade. It
will not be possible to describe in detail in this book the many
attempts that have been made to measure the various
personality characteristics. All that we can reasonably do is
to outline some typical examples of the various methods.
and hope that those who are interested will go further in
the study by extra reading.
4. METHODS OF PERSONALITY MEASUREMENT
There are three main methods of measuring personality
characteristics. The first method assumes some relationship
between anatomical structures and activity, and therefore
measures physical features. The second method consists
of estimates and ratings. This is really an attempt to make
subjective impressions as reliable as possible. The third
157


## p. 158 (#174) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
method is the use of objective test situations. We will con-
sider each one of these methods in turn.
a. The determination of personality from anatomical structure.
One of the earliest attempts to make use of structure
in order to determine personality and character traits was
phrenology. Phrenology had its beginning over a hundred
years ago in the work of Gall and Spurzheim, and was later
popularized by the Fowler brothers. Phrenology is based on
the assumption that personality characteristics are located
in particular parts of the brain and that an overdevelop-
ment or an underdevelopment of that part of the brain.
means that that particular personality trait is also over- or
underdeveloped. This assumption is absolutely ungrounded
in fact. There is no such localization of personality char-
acteristics in the brain.
A further assumption is that the development of a part
of the brain would be indicated by a corresponding develop-
ment of the skull. This, again, is not true. Another assump-
tion, equally ill-founded, is that if one individual is seen to
possess some particular personality characteristic in a large
degree and he also has an overdevelopment of some part
of the skull, it follows that anyone with such a skull develop-
ment will possess that particular characteristic of behavior.
The basic assumptions of phrenology have all been experi-
mentally disproved. We have devoted this much space to
phrenology merely because there are still enough people
who take it so seriously as to make it a profitable business.
Character analysis by means of other physical charac-
teristics is still with us, even though carefully conducted
experiments have shown that there is no fundamental
relationship between the shape of the face or the color
of the complexion and personality characteristics. Systems
of physiognomy and systems of character analysis based
on blond and brunet types have all yielded negative
results when subjected to carefully controlled experimenta-
158


## p. 159 (#175) ############################################

PERSONALITY AND ITS MEASUREMENT
tion. Lombroso's criminal types based on physical char-
acteristics have not been able to stand the searchlight of
experimental inquiry. In general, it can be said with a fair
degree of certainty that physical structure cannot in any
way be taken as an indication of personality.
b. Rating methods.
One of the earliest methods of measuring character-
istics of activity was the rating scale. This is a technique
designed to make estimates of personality characteristics
a little less subjective and a little more accurate than the
usual estimate or judgment about individuals. Rating
methods are used extensively in large industrial and financial
establishments, as well as in educational systems, to assist
in making and tabulating estimates of individuals for pur-
poses of promotion, transfer, and so on. Symonds lists the
following advantages of ratings:
They are an aid in administration.
They stimulate the person rated.
They react in a favorable way on the person doing the rating.
If periodically given, they help keep alive the personnel spirit.
They help to make judgments analytical.
If systematically given, they tend to make judgment repre-
sentative.
of
They are a means of getting data for research purposes.
Almost any personality characteristic may be used in
a rating scale. The tendency has been to use a wide variety
personality traits in one scale, but there is a limit to the
number of characteristics that can be included in a scale and
still keep it reliable and usable.
Ratings are always imperfect; but when they are carefully
made and when certain necessary precautions are observed,
they are much better than the hit-and-miss snap-judgment
methods that they are designed to replace. For personality
features for which there are no objective tests the rating
method is useful.
159


## p. 160 (#176) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
.
There are a number of ways of constructing a rating
scale. The simplest form of rating is simply to rank the
individuals of a group in order of merit in a particular
trait. This method does not admit of the comparison of
individuals from different groups, nor is it applicable with
any degree of reliability to a large group. Another rating
method is the man-to-man comparison scale, such as has
been used in the United States army to rate officers on
various characteristics. Another rating method is to use
descriptive phrases. For instance, if you were rating an
individual for a trait like leadership, your judgment would

be aided by such phrases as: probably unable to lead his
fellows, satisfied to have others take the lead, sometimes
leads in minor affairs, sometimes leads in important affairs,
displays marked ability to lead his fellows. The rater would
be required to check the descriptive phrase that best de-
scribed the individual being rated.
The graphic rating scale is still another type. The rater
checks along a line, which is supposed to represent degrees
in the trait from one extreme to another. Sometimes the
line is divided into units, and the rating may be assisted by
descriptive phrases placed along the line. An example of
one unit in a graphic scale used to rate workers is given
above.
c. Objective methods.
Although rating scales may be useful in some situations,
wherever possible they should be replaced by more objective
160


## p. 161 (#177) ############################################

PERSONALITY AND ITS MEASUREMENT
methods of measurement. There are four major classifica-
tions of methods of objective measurement of personality
characteristics, which we will consider in turn.
1. The measurement of personal-history facts. The usual
methods of obtaining personal-history data to be used in
making an estimate of the individual's personality are the
interview, the application blank, and the case-history
method. The interview method of obtaining estimates of
personality is notoriously inaccurate and incomplete; it
can hardly be called an objective measurement method.
However, there are certain features of the interview that
are subject to improvement and standardization. The
inaccuracies of testimony, memory, and the force of sug-
gestion from the form of the questions used tend to make
the interview method of gathering information of slight
significance.
The application blank is another method of gathering
personal data, and closely related to it is the questionnaire
to be filled in by acquaintances of the individual. Such
forms usually require great care in their construction, so
that the information obtained may be both as objective and
as reliable as possible.
A number of studies of such information and its bear-
ing on success have been made. For instance, one study
scored in points the following items of information about
life insurance salesmen and then compared these scores
with success: age, number of dependents, amount of previous
income, previous occupation, number of changes in position
during the last five years, amount of selling experience,
number of investments, amount of life insurance, percentage
of income saved, amount of education and length of time
since completion, business or correspondence courses, mem-
bership in organizations, number of offices held. The results
showed that, of those with low scores, 10 were successful
and 38 failed; of those with middle scores, 43 were successful
and 47 failed; and, of those with high scores, 47 were success-
161


## p. 162 (#178) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
ful and 15 failed. All the items in this summary could be
objectively answered; that is, there was no room for sub-
jective judgment, as the questions could be answered in
terms of fact.
Such information may be of real value in getting an
estimate of the individual. What is required is careful
study of the relation of the various items to actual life
success, and then scoring the presence or absence of that
characteristic in the personal-history schedule.
The third method of gathering personal-history data is
the case study, which is a comprehensive history of the
individual. The case history is just as good and no better
than the methods used in gathering the data. The kind of
information included in a case study depends on the aim or
purpose involved. If the aim is to make a complete psy-
chological study of the subject, every factor that may have
any significance is included. The heredity, the physical
constitution, the educational history, the developmental
history, intelligence, special abilities, such environmental
factors as the home and the community, habitual activities,
companions, behavior characteristics, emotional stability,
reputation, ideals, ambitions-these are some of the factors
that are studied. Usually the study is made for a particular
purpose, in which case the number of factors included may
not be so comprehensive.
2. Physiological changes as personality indicators. Some
personality characteristics may be studied indirectly through
visceral behavior. The personality factor that has received
special attention from this approach is emotion. There is a
very close relationship between emotional characteristics
and physiological processes. However, as yet physiological
measurements cannot be used as measurements of emotional
traits, but are considered merely as indicators of temporary
emotional states. The chief physiological indicators of emo-
tion that have been studied are heart rate and pattern,
blood volume, blood pressure, breathing changes, psycho-
162


## p. 163 (#179) ############################################

PERSONALITY AND ITS MEASUREMENT
galvanic reflex, and metabolic changes. These physiological
changes have been employed with a certain degree of success
in the measurement of lying and deception.
3. The study of personality through verbal behavior.
In studying personality characteristics through the spoken
or written verbal responses of the individual, it is assumed
that such responses may be taken as an indication of basic
personality traits. There are many kinds of personality tests
making use of verbal behavior, of which the more important
are association tests, question and answer tests, attitude scales,
and tests of knowledge and judgment of social and ethical
values. We shall look briefly at each one of these in turn.
Association tests are of various kinds and have various
uses. Continuous free association, where the subject is
started on a train of reverie and continues until he can go
no further, has been used by the psychoanalysts as a means
of indicating what they call complexes.
Another kind of free association test is that in which the
subject is given a stimulus word and responds orally with
the first word that "comes into his head." Kent and Rosanoff,
using a standard list of 100 words, gave this test to 1,000
subjects and tabulated the replies, so that they would have
a measure of the "commonness" of the reply to each of the
stimulus words. This test can be used to get at emotional
difficulties, as well as to study the general character of the
associations used by an individual. That is, by a comparison
of the individual's responses with the responses of the 1,000
cases, it is possible to discover whether the individual char-
acteristically gives individual responses; if so, it is assumed
that he is introverted.
Another kind of association test is the Rohrshach test,
which consists of a series of ink blots, some of which are in
colors. The subject is shown these ink blots and his inter-
pretations of what they represent aid in discovering some-
thing about his mental habits. Association tests have been
used as indicators of emotional complexes, as a means of
163

detecting lying and guilt, as an aid in diagnosing insanity,
as a measure of ability, and as a measure of interest.
The question and answer type of personality test has
had a wide use in the last few years. A number of such tests
have been produced, designed to measure a wide variety of
personality traits. The individual is studied by being asked
questions relative to his beliefs, wishes, likes, interests,
tastes, preferences, choices, feelings, fears, and worries.
Such tests are usually pencil and paper tests, in which the
subject either marks one of a number of answers to a given
question, or answers in terms of yes or no, or marks the
statement as true or false, or employs some comparable
method of indicating a reaction to a set question or statement.
We shall have to content ourselves here with the mere
mention of a number of typical verbal tests. The Wood-
worth Psychoneurotic Inventory is a set of over a hundred
questions to which the subject answers either yes or no.
This test is useful in classifying and grouping individuals
in terms of ability to make adjustments to life situations,
and in serving as an indicator of difficulties in such adjust-
ments. A number of revisions and adaptations of this test
have been made by other investigators. The Pressey Cross
Out tests are a series of tests designed for the measurement
of emotional characteristics. In these, the subject is required
to cross out words that refer to unpleasant things, to things
that he considers wrong, to things about which he has
worried, and so on. Introversion-extroversion tests have
been designed by Laird, Marston, and Heidbreder. Allport
and Allport constructed a test that was supposed to measure
what they called ascendency and submission, and which may
be valuable in the measurement of one feature of leadership.
Bernreuter adapted several tests into one scale, which he
called a personality inventory. This scale may be scored in
four ways to yield a measure of neurotic tendency, a measure
of self-sufficiency, a measure of introversion-extroversion,
and a measure of dominance-submission.
164

PERSONALITY AND ITS MEASUREMENT
Although these tests are still in the experimental stage
and require more work before they can be taken seriously
as measures of personality traits, they have already demon-
strated their usefulness in planning vocational placement,
in studying the adequacy of educational procedures, and in
determining which individuals are maladjusted and require
further study and advice.
The study of attitudes by means of verbal responses has
had considerable success. Following the work of Allport,
Thurstone has perfected a method of measuring attitude
that has given reliable results. By an elaborate statisti-
cal procedure a scale is constructed. This scale is com-
posed of statements bearing on the subject toward which
the attitude of the 'individual is to be measured. Each
one of these statements has a numerical value, and the
subject is required to mark those statements with which
he is in agreement. In this way attitudes toward a wide
variety of subjects, such as particular nationalities, war,
God, religion, motion pictures, corporal punishment, and
many others, can be measured.
Tests have also been designed to measure interest to-
ward various occupations and activities. Perhaps the
most important of these attempts are those of Freyd and
Strong. Strong's Vocational Interest Blank may serve
as a very useful instrument in the guidance of boys into
the line of work in which they will have the greatest prob-
ability of success. Strong has found that "members of each
occupational group have characteristic likes and dislikes,
which distinguish them from other occupational groups,'
and also that "these vocational interests are present in
college freshmen and are not materially altered by technical
training and subsequent professional experience."
It is possible to measure knowledge and judgment of
ethical and social values by means of verbal tests. One
method employed is to test the vocabulary of the individual
in relation to knowledge of words with a moral connotation,
165


## p. 166 (#182) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
slang, etc. A test of good manners has been constructed,
in which the knowledge of standards of courtesy and good
manners is measured. Numerous tests of Biblical knowledge
and information have been designed. Moral-judgment tests
of various kinds have also been used. These tests are, at best,
but an indirect means of discovering basic character and
personality traits and tendencies. A person may know what
is right and yet act in a very different manner; likewise,
he may not accept intellectually a moral code, yet in actual
practice may live up to it. Tests of actual conduct are per-
haps much more reliable than tests of knowledge and judg-
ment about conduct.
d. The study of personality through tests of performance.
The most obvious method of measuring conduct is by
a direct record of actual performance. However, this method
has a number of difficulties to overcome. In testing intelli-
gence, the measurement of ability is in terms of performance
on certain set problems; but the use of performance to
measure a personality characteristic such as honesty requires
a certain amount of maneuvering. Arithmetic problems
can be used not only to get a measure of arithmetic ability,
but also to determine whether a child would cheat if given
the opportunity, or to test the preference of children as to
working alone or with others. It is necessary, in using
performance as a means of measuring personality char-
acteristics, to keep the subject unaware of the attempt to
measure such features. In measuring intelligence or learning
ability, the subject is aware of what is being done and tries
to do his best, while, in the measurement of honesty or any
other character or personality feature, it is necessary that
the subject be kept in the dark about the project, because
what is desired is not a picture of what he can do but what
he actually does.
Hartshorne and May have conducted a rather extensive
study of conduct and used a wide variety of test situa-
166


## p. 167 (#183) ############################################

PERSONALITY AND ITS MEASUREMENT
tions. The results of this study have been published in a
number of volumes, and can only be indicated briefly
here. In their book, Studies in Deceit, Hartshorne and
May describe the various tests they used in the measure-
ment of cheating, stealing, and lying, which they con-
ceived to be the three kinds of deceit. Tests of cheating
included copying when given the opportunity; the duplicat-
ing technique, in which original answers are recorded
secretly on the answer paper, the subject being given an
opportunity to change his answers when he is marking his
own paper; the improbable-achievement technique, or a
test that cannot possibly be done honestly, in which a high
score would indicate cheating; the double-testing technique,
in which the subject is asked whether he can do certain
things and then is actually tested on them. Tests of stealing
were designed in such a way as to give a chance to steal
money and other objects; but, unknown to the subjects,
conditions were arranged so that the stealing could be
accurately detected. Tests of lying used by Hartshorne and
May were pencil and paper tests, in which the subjects
answered questions. Some of these questions were designed
to get a measure of lying to avoid disapproval and others to
measure lying to win approval.
Another personality trait that has been subjected to
objective measurement is suggestibility. The degree to which
the subject either follows suggestions that are contrary to
fact, or resists suggestions, is measured in various test
situations. Persistence is still another personality character-
istic that has been measured with objective test situations.
Fernald made use of the simple test of the length of time a
subject can stand on his toes. When he used this test to
compare a group of reformatory prisoners with a group of
high-school boys, he had rather striking results. The average
persistence of the prison group was less than 15 minutes
and that of the high-school group 36 minutes. The highest
score among the prisoners was less than an hour, while the
167


## p. 168 (#184) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
highest score among the students was over two hours and a
half. Other ingenious tests of persistence have been invented,
such as a maze impossible of accomplishment, persistence
being measured in terms of the length of time that the
subject will keep trying; the use of two different and difficult
puzzles, with persistence measured in terms of the length
of time spent on the first before trying the second; and
monotonous tasks, such as simple additions.
Other performance tests have been designed to measure
cooperation, service, inhibition, caution, speed of decision,
aggressiveness, and studiousness. Examples of some of these
may be found in Studies in Service and Self-control, by
Hartshorne, May, and Maller.
All these tests of performance are too new and relatively
untried to be evaluated. It may be that they will fulfill a
very important need in the measurement of personality,
but it is also possible that they may have to be discarded
as unreliable.
Personality is a very complex thing and very difficult
to analyze and evaluate. However, a real beginning has
been made in the scientific study of this feature of human
activity. The term itself has had a great variety of meanings
and should be given a more precise definition. By "per-
sonality" the psychologist means the total habits, attitudes,
and permanent behavior tendencies of the individual.
Some of these habits can be described and some can be
measured with some degree of definiteness and accuracy.
Although a real start has been made, much remains to be
done before the measurement of personality characteristics can
be considered to have acquired a practical and usable method.

RELATIONS WITH OTHER PEOPLE
One of the most important adjustments that an individual
has to make is that of living with other people. Nearly every
important human situation is a social situation. This is
true in both work and play. The mental health of the
individual depends to a great extent on the success of his
social adjustment.

Chapter XII
SOCIAL RELATIONS
G
I. INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT
REAT advances have been made in the last century in
the management of the material part of our world.
We have learned how to use materials so as to add to our
comfort and convenience; but we have not made correspond-
ing advances in managing social relationships. This is
not because human relationships are so much more com-
plex than radio waves, for instance, but because we have
not given enough attention to the business of living with
others. Even a superficial study of the world in which we
live would indicate clearly that human beings fail quite
frequently in this important job of getting along with one
another. Look, for instance, at marriage and estimate how
many are successful in this human relationship; or look at
business and see how often difficulties arise because people
have not yet learned to work together very well; or look
at the larger scene, with the recurring wars and rumors of
wars among the nations of the world.
Effective human relationships are possible. True, to be
successful in our social relationships, we need to study and
practice; but human conflict and disagreement is not in-
evitable. In this chapter we will examine a number of
illustrations of effective human relationships and the
factors involved. First we will look at some general prin-
ciples and then we will see how these principles work in
some specific situations.
2. GETTING ALONG WITH OTHERS-
PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS
To get along well with other people-parents, children,
neighbors, friends, roommates, business associates, etc.—
173


## p. 174 (#190) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
it is necessary to take into account a number of basic fea-
tures of human nature. Every person wants to feel impor-
tant. Every person dislikes being made to feel small and
unimportant. Everyone is striving for a place in the sun.
Everyone wants to be liked and thought well of. These
simple facts should help us to understand why we some-
times succeed and sometimes fail in our contacts with
others. Examine your failures and successes, and you will
probably realize that you were successful when you made it
possible for the other person to satisfy his desire for im-
portance and you failed in social effectiveness when you
denied the other person the chance to have at least some of
the spotlight. Keeping this in mind, we can work out a
number of simple suggestions for effective social relationships
or practical rules for getting along well with others.
a. Be genuinely interested in other people.
People are the most interesting part of our world, and
so it should not be difficult to be interested in them. Without
a sincere interest in others it is impossible to get along very
effectively with them. A genuine interest in others means
that you forget yourself for the time being, that you listen
to what they have to say, that you show your interest in
what they are doing and thinking and feeling. It is always
pleasant to have someone take a real interest in what you
are saying, doing, or feeling; and this atmosphere of pleasant-
ness makes it possible to start off in the right direction.
Effective social relationships are based on mutual liking
and respect, and liking and respect are possible only between
those who have interest in each other.
b. Avoid creating a feeling of inferiority.
Try to put the other person on an equal level with yourself
or on a higher level. This seems to be just the reverse of
our usual practice, which is to lord it over the other person
174


## p. 175 (#191) ############################################

SOCIAL RELATIONS
if possible, to make him feel small by making ourselves
appear important. This is why we so often lose out in our
social relationships; for when we emphasize our own im-
portance, we cannot fail to make the other person seem less
important, and this of course is far from pleasant or satisfy-
ing to him. Thus there is a wrong tone about the whole
situation. If, however, we can forget for the time being our
desire to be the important person and allow the other to
assume a superior position, we succeed in getting along with
him. Our training has been such that most of us are selfish;
that is, we put our own desires and feelings first, and because
of this we tend to fail in our attempts to live happily with
friends, wives, or neighbors.
c. Use sincere appreciation.
This is one method which rarely fails in getting desired
results. A sincere word of praise, a pat on the back, makes
the recipient glow with pleasure. We are usually too stingy
with our words of appreciation, partly because we are think-
ing too much of ourselves and not enough of the other
person. If we truly think that someone has done something
well, we should never hesitate to tell him so; but unless
the commendation is sincere, the word of praise will be
entirely hollow and ineffective.
d. Eliminate criticism and disapproval.
Many social contacts are spoiled because the individual
thinks it is necessary to criticize or disapprove of the other
person or his behavior. Criticism always implies that the
person criticizing thinks himself better than the other
person, that he placed himself on a higher level than the
other person. Criticism is usually unnecessary; we can get
along better without it. Moreover, it rarely accomplishes
what it is designed to do, for no one can profit by something
that he resents.
175


## p. 176 (#192) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
e. Let the other person correct his own errors.
Most people realize that they make mistakes and usually
know what the mistakes are; but, when someone else points
out these mistakes, it acts as a challenge to defend them
rather than an incentive to correct them. At the same time,
a rather unpleasant feeling arises toward the person who
called attention to the mistakes. To point out mistakes to
anyone serves to make him feel small and unimportant,
to put him on a lower level; and, when this happens, we
cannot expect to get along well with him.
f. Never try openly to make other people over.
No one likes to feel that he needs to be reformed. Every-
one knows that he is not perfect, but he does not like to
think that someone else is trying to correct his imperfections.
Many a bride has started in the wrong direction in her
married life because she has been indiscreet enough to
indicate that she thought she could make her husband
over. It may be all right for the bride to believe that by
marrying the man she can help to reform him, but it is
always a mistake to let him know it.
g. Cultivate the habit of sympathy.
By "sympathy" is meant "feeling with the other person."
To sympathize, one imagines how the other person feels
and feels the same way oneself. The successful individual
in social relationships is the person who has learned to
consider the other person's feelings, to know how he feels
about things, and to take this knowledge into account.
He respects the other person's feelings and never does
anything to make him feel resentful or hurt. He has learned
how to "feel with" others.
h. Cultivate the habit of tolerance.
Tolerance is the ability to appreciate the other person,
whether or not his religious or political views are the same
176


## p. 177 (#193) ############################################

SOCIAL RELATIONS
as one's own, and whether or not he happens to be of the
same race, nationality, or economic status. Tolerance does
not imply accepting the beliefs and opinions of others, but
it does require that we shall not cut ourselves off from
association with others just because they happen to be differ-
ent in some ways from ourselves.
i. Remember that all persons are different.
No two persons are exactly alike. What works with one
does not necessarily work with another. Each should be
treated as an individual with his own peculiar personality.
This means that we should take into account individual
differences and not expect that everyone will have the same
likes and dislikes, the same desires, the same interests as
everyone else. We respect the other person's interests and
do not think that there is something peculiar about him
because he happens to like different things from those that
we like, or have different ideas from those that we have.
j. Check first impressions.
Guard against first impressions and snap judgments
of people. First impressions are often highly inaccurate.
It is possible to take a violent dislike to a person on the
first meeting, for no very good reason-perhaps, merely
because the color of his hair or the shape of his nose recalls
vague memories of someone else whom we had cause to dislike.
It is better to reserve judgment about an individual until
you really know him. Better yet, it is desirable to look for
and find in every person you meet some good point that
can form the basis for a liking.
k. Think more of giving than of getting.
Think of friendships and social relations in terms of
contributing rather than of getting. We are more successful
in social relationships when we think of what we can con-
tribute rather than of what we can get from them. It is so
177


## p. 178 (#194) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
easy to slip into the habit of looking for advantages for
ourselves that we often spoil social relationships in this
way. It is much more effective to think in terms of what
we can give, what we have to offer to the social situation.
Then we are not continually worried lest someone step on
our toes or violate our rights, and we are thinking in terms
of the other person instead of our own personal desires and
profit.
These suggestions have a solid foundation in psychological
fact and have been verified in practice many times by many
persons. They should enable anyone who seriously tries
them out to be more effective socially and to find greater
enjoyment in social contacts.
3. SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE
Marriage is a social relationship into which most human
beings enter. That all marriages are not successful is obvious,
and that the percentage of failure in marriage is rather high
is also evident. Research is gradually accumulating informa-
tion indicating the factors that contribute to success or
failure in marriage. Although there is much still to discover,
it is possible at present to point out some of these important
factors.
One fact that is clear is that success or failure in marriage
is not dependent entirely on what happens after the marriage
ceremony, but that there are features of the previous ex-
perience of the two parties that are also important. The
picture of the development of the heterosexual affections
of the individual from early years must be considered.
The relationship between the child and his parents and the
kind of attachments built up then may contribute to marital
success and happiness. For instance, a strong attachment
toward the parent of the same sex or a strong aversion
toward the parent of the opposite sex may make it difficult
for the individual to attain a healthy, normal, heterosexual
development. The character of the sex education that the
178


## p. 179 (#195) ############################################

SOCIAL RELATIONS
individual has received also makes a difference in his marital
adjustment. For instance, because of a faulty or an inade-
quate sex education, the individual may develop an idea
that sex is vulgar, shameful, nasty, or fearful; thus, he has
a poor start in this important intimate social adjustment.
Or he may have learned to separate love and sex and think
of them as separate and apart and again have difficulty in
making a satisfactory adjustment. Another feature of this
development is the kind of impressions that the individual
gains about himself during childhood and adolescence-ideas
as to what other people think of him or, at least, what he
thinks others think of him, which may either help or hinder
his adjustment in marriage. Also, the daydreams, brought
about by books, motion pictures, stories, conversations,
etc., which the individual has about his future partner or
about what marriage means may have their effect on the
marital adjustment. Any sex experiences, such as exhibition-
ism or masturbation, may leave their mark on the individual.
The effect of such experiences is detrimental mainly because
of the feelings of guilt or sin that the individual has rather
than any direct effect from the experience itself.
Another feature related to success or failure in marriage
is the adequacy of the courtship period. Courtship is a
valuable preliminary to marriage, for it is a period of pre-
liminary adjustment during which the two individuals
explore each other's emotional life, likes and dislikes, and
personalities. They test their compatibility by social, mental,
and emotional intimacy. They learn about each others'
habits, ideals, attitudes on religion, family life, politics, etc.
Without an adequate courtship period, success in marriage
is not so assured.
It has been shown that similarity of interests and attitudes
on recreation, religion, table manners, care of children,
the handling of finances, and related matters is conducive
to marital success. When there is too great a difference in
these matters there are more chances for disagreement and
179


## p. 180 (#196) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
discord. Also, similarity in personal characteristics, such as
temperament and character, gives a greater chance of success
than does extreme difference between the two individuals.
Similarity in educational and cultural background is also
better than differences in these factors, for nationality and
religious differences tend to lead to difficulties. The same
principle holds for economic status. A history of happy family
relationships and normal affection for parents is another
factor related to success. These are not the only factors in
marital success, but they are some of the more important
ones. The principles outlined in the previous section on
getting along with others can be applied to the marriage
situation in particular.
4. THE APPLICATION OF PSYCHOLOGY TO SOME SAMPLE SOCIAL
PROBLEMS
The solution of most social problems involves a knowledge
of human nature and conduct. Poverty, unemployment,
delinquency and crime, industrial unrest, and war are
some of our more serious social problems. Although psy-
chology has not complete answers to these problems, psy-
chological methods and knowledge can be of use. Let us
look at one sample social problem, that of delinquency, and
see in what ways psychology can be of help.
The juvenile delinquent is a boy or a girl who has been
discovered stealing, damaging property, or exhibiting some
other such behavior that is contrary to law. The delinquent
is an individual who has failed to learn the right things and
who has been successful in learning some of the wrong
things. He is behaving in a way that he thinks will bring
him the greatest satisfaction. He is, in fact, satisfying some
of the same wants that a nondelinquent child satisfies in
more acceptable ways. He is not greatly different from other
children and will not necessarily or inevitably become an
adult criminal. However, if the tendencies to behave in an
antisocial manner are not redirected, he will continue on
180


## p. 181 (#197) ############################################

SOCIAL RELATIONS
the wrong path and his delinquency may develop into serious
crime.
Many studies of the juvenile delinquent have indicated
some conditions that tend to produce delinquency. An
inadequate environment and inadequate training and
supervision sum up most of these conditions. Poverty,
defective marital relationships of the parents, broken
homes (one parent missing), bad companions, lack of ade-
quate recreational activities, and other related conditions
have been shown to be much more frequent among delin-
quents than among nondelinquents. In any large city there
are areas in which delinquency is much more prevalent than
in other areas of the same city. An examination of these
areas indicates a poor environment for the active child-
crowded living conditions, lack of playgrounds, little equip-
ment for games, and a rather poor kind of commercial amuse-
ment. By far the most important factor in delinquency,
however, is the kind of persons with whom the child lives—
his parents and neighbors.
Low intelligence in itself is not a cause of delinquency;
but low intelligence along with an environment that is
arranged for the person of average intelligence can help
to produce the delinquent. Two cases may be mentioned
that may be considered typical of many others. The first
is that of a boy whose intelligence would classify him as
borderline; that is, an I.Q. in the seventies. He starts going
to school and is expected there to do the schoolwork at the
same rate as the other children. He is always the slowest
in the class and the one with the most mistakes. He is
the classroom dunce. He soon learns to hate school because
he can never do as well as the other children; and soon he
starts falling behind and finds himself with children younger
than himself. Staying away from school occasionally, he
becomes a truant and his career of delinquency has begun.
Playing truant, he finds companions who are also truant,
and they, in looking for something to do, find that they want
181


## p. 182 (#198) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
things they haven't got and soon start stealing. Perhaps
he is caught by his parents, who punish him for his behavior,
and he runs away from home and gets into more trouble.
He is a delinquent not merely because he is dull in intelli-
gence but because his dullness is not taken into consideration
in arranging his education and activities.
The other case is that of a boy of very high intelligence
who is not allowed by his proud mother to associate with
other boys or to take part in club activities. His need for
activity goes unsatisfied until he discovers ways and means
of deceiving his mother and taking part in all kinds of
adventurous activities, such as housebreaking and car
theft. He is a delinquent not because he has a high I.Q.,
but because his high intelligence is not taken into account
in providing him with satisfying activities.
Delinquency can be prevented, and in most cases the
delinquent can be cured of his criminal tendencies. Pre-
vention is easier and more economical in the long run.
Prevention involves providing for every child an environ-
ment suitable to his best development. This means seeing
that every child has decent living conditions, provision for
play, and a chance to take part in healthy and satisfying
group activities. It means providing for every child a chance
to feel secure and wanted. It means supervision by indi-
viduals who understand the needs of the child; and it means
schools and teachers who can provide an educational system
that is adequate for the dull and the bright, as well as for
the average child.
Methods of dealing with the child when he has become
delinquent are designed to discover the causes of his
present
condition and then to go about the job of removing these
conditions or providing a new set of conditions, so that
he can learn what he had failed to learn before. Punishment
is not the best method of dealing with the delinquent, for
punishment often makes him even more set in his delinquent
ways. Therefore, the modern juvenile court provides the
182

The best way to curb delinquency and crime is by preventing it. Preven-
tion involves providing the child with a suitable environment for his
interest and development.

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
facilities for studying the individual child and arranging a
course of treatment designed to reeducate him. The success
of such a program for juvenile delinquents may lead eventu-
ally to similar methods for adult criminals. They, too,
need study and treatment more than they need punishment.
Psychology has been applied with great benefit in other
types of social problems. We will merely mention a number
of such areas of application without going into detail. There
is the problem of immigration, which would benefit from
psychological method and knowledge. There is the problem
of the bettering of the intelligence of the nation, of the rela-
tionship between moving pictures and morals, problems of
education, propaganda, public opinion and its measurement.
These and many other related problems have profited from
psychological method and information. In fact, any problem
involving human nature and conduct is a problem about
which the psychologist can have something to say.

Chapter XIII
VOCATIONAL
ADJUSTMENT
Ο
I. INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT
NE of the most important adjustments that the indi-
vidual has to make in life is in the world of work-
finding his place and adjusting happily and efficiently so
that he may be able to make his best contribution to life.
This is an adjustment that many fail to make very satis-
factorily. A survey of any large industry or business would
indicate that a fairly large percentage of the workers are not
happy in their work, and in many cases not particularly well
suited for the work that they are doing. In this chapter we
will indicate how psychology can be applied to two major
vocational problems-vocational selection and vocational
adjustment.
2. VOCATIONAL SELECTION
Vocational selection has two main aspects-the selection.
of a job by the individual and the selection of an individual
for a job by industry. Actually, these two are the same
problem, involving the same general principles and requiring
both the appraisal of the individual and the analysis of the
job. We will look at these two steps first and then consider
vocational guidance, which is designed to aid the individual
to find the most suitable kind of work for himself, and finally
look at employment methods designed to help find the best
person
for a particular job.
a. The appraisal of the individual.
This is the attempt to obtain a picture of the individual
so as to be able to guide him into a vocation or decide
186

VOCATIONAL ADJUSTMENT
whether he is suitable for a particular position. This ap-
praisal may be made by the individual himself or it may be
made by someone else—a vocational guidance expert or an
employment officer. There are a number of important
features that should be included in this appraisal. The
following are among the more important of them.
1. Ability. Some measure of the individual's general ability
should be obtained. One simple method is to use a good
intelligence test. Another way is to examine his academic
progress to discover whether he progressed at a normal,
retarded, or accelerated rate in his schoolwork and also
what point he reached in the school system. His grades,
failures, and successes should be examined, as well as the
age at which he attained the various grades. Besides his
general ability, some indication of special abilities should
also be ascertained, such as mechanical, mathematical,
artistic, musical, or other abilities.
2. Education and training. A picture of the education,
both general and special, that the individual has had is
necessary also. How far did he go in school? What special
training has he had? What are the possibilities for further
education?
3. Personality. What is he like? What personality char-
acteristics are prominent or absent? What about his emo-
tional maturity and stability? Is he socially competent?
What are his assets and liabilities as far as temperament is
concerned? These are some questions that should be an-
swered in getting the necessary personality appraisal. This
part of the picture can be obtained either by means of tests
such as were mentioned in a previous chapter or by ratings
and estimates made by persons who know him well.
4. Interests. This individual appraisal would not be
complete without a picture of the individual's interests.
Here we need to know what types of things he is most
interested in and likes doing, and what kind of activities.
he dislikes and thus avoids. This picture can be obtained

WHAT VOCATION WILL YOU CHOOSE TO FOLLOW?

Three of the many vocations for men (above) are those of the technician,
the airplane pilot, and the salesman. Girls have a more limited field from
which to select a vocation; but teaching, office work, and laboratory work
(below) are a few of the possibilities.

by finding out how he has used his spare time, what hobbies
he has had, what kinds of books he reads, and what choices
he has made. Interest tests such as the Strong Interest Blank
should also be helpful.
5. Health. A record of his health, both present and past,
is also valuable because some kinds of work require a rather
high degree of physical stamina. A brief history of the sick-
ness he has experienced, the time he has lost from school or
work, should give part of this picture, although a complete
physical examination by a physician is always valuable.
To aid in making a self-appraisal for vocational purposes,
the following list of questions should prove of some help.
Have I thoroughly enjoyed any subject I have studied? What
studies have I most enjoyed? Have I done extra work in any
subject? If so, why was I specially interested in that subject?
What type of books interest me most? What section, other than
fiction, interests me in the library? What are the subjects of the
public lectures that attract my attention?
To what extent did I buy and sell and trade with others? Was
I successful in such business ventures or did the other boys usually
get the better of me?
What, if anything, have I built with tools? Do I do good work
with tools? In such work do I delight in accuracy and precision or
does anything go?
To what position of responsibility have I been appointed at
school, college, or other authorities? Why was I appointed? Why
was I not appointed to such positions as I desired?
To what positions have I been elected by my fellows? To what
desired positions have I failed to be elected? Why? How well did I
fill the offices? Am I recognized as a leader by my associates? Why
or why not?
Do I like to be in the limelight or do I prefer to be behind the
scenes? Do I get more pleasure out of following or leading? Is it
for me to get followers?
easy
Am I always just to others? Do I give the praise and encour-
agement to others that they deserve?
To what extent do others give me their confidence? their
loyalty?
To what extent do others seek my advice? To what extent am
I able to help others straighten out their difficulties?
189


## p. 190 (#206) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
Do I like to work alone or with others? Am I able to cooperate
in a common activity with others? To what extent do I incline
to be helpful and sympathetic to others?
Do I worry over the difficulties and results of my work? Am I
sensitive to the opinions of others? Am I irritated easily by the
criticisms of others?
Am I able to suggest ways of doing things to others without
antagonizing or offending them? Do I like to be with people
much of the time? Am I confident and at ease in the presence of
others or am I easily embarrassed?
Am I able to speak before large groups of people? Before small
groups? Am I able to hold the interest of the audience? Can I
express my thoughts readily in writing?
Can I evaluate plans, projects, schemes easily? Can I visualize
the possible results of plans of action? What successes have I had
in making clear and definite plans and objectives?
Do I enjoy detail work? Do I need a boss to make me be
thorough and accurate?
What kinds of activities have I been most interested in? Have
I an especially interesting hobby? Why am I interested in this?
What vocation is it mostly related to?
b. Job appraisal.
Another essential in a vocational selection program is
job appraisal. If the individual is to make a wise selection of
a vocation it is necessary for him to know considerable
about a number of kinds of work. Some of the features about
vocations that should be known are these:
1. The education required. It is relatively simple to dis-
cover what general and specific education is required for
most vocations. As a rule, they require a certain level of
general education and some special training.
2. The general ability required by the job. It is a disadvan-
tage to have either too high or too low general intelligence
for a job. When the individual has more intelligence than is
required by a particular vocation, he usually becomes dis-
contented very quickly; and, of course, if he has not as much
ability as the job requires, he will soon become a misfit
or a failure in that job.

3. The special abilities or aptitudes required. Some voca-
tions require a special talent-musical, artistic, mechanical,
mathematical or at least good sensory equipment. For
instance, color blindness is a detriment in many vocations.
4. Physical and health requirements. Obviously, some
vocations require a physical and health standard to fall
short of which will lead to failure.
5. Personality and temperament. Certain personality char-
acteristics are an asset for some jobs and a drawback for
others. For instance, a salesman requires a particular kind
of personality, including a tendency toward extroversion and
dominance.
6. Interest patterns. Interest is an important feature of
vocational placement. It is better for the individual to have
the kind of interests typical of the successful members of a
vocation that he is choosing.
7. Satisfactions offered by the vocation. One feature of
vocations that should not be overlooked is the kind of satis-
factions that the various jobs supply. This includes income,
social position, chances for creative activities, opportunities
for advancement, chances for initiative, etc.
c. Vocational guidance.
Much has been said and written about square pegs in
round holes, and many people have formed the idea that
there is just one perfect vocational niche for each person.
This is not true. There are usually not one but a number of
places where an individual can fit into the world of work;
but no job exactly fits any individual. Jobs and people do
not exactly fit. There are always features of a particular
job that may be suitable for the individual, but there are
always some features that do not suit his personality, likes,
interests, or abilities. The problem, then, is to help the
individual to find a place where he can be happy and where
his peculiar make-up will allow him to make his best con-
tribution; but he should not expect to find a perfect fit.
192


## p. 193 (#209) ############################################

VOCATIONAL ADJUSTMENT
Vocational guidance should be guidance, not steering,
of the individual. The most serious danger is that the coun-
selor will try to tell the individual what he should do. A
person makes his best vocational adjustment when he feels
that he, himself, has selected his field of work. Guidance
can help to provide the chances to find out about the kinds
of jobs there are to do and what those jobs are like and what
they require of the individual and what they offer to the
individual. It can also help the individual to make an ap-
praisal of himself can provide tests, for instance, for
general intelligence, special aptitudes, and personality char-
acteristics and help to interpret the results of these tests.
Vocational guidance is better when it takes place over a
fairly long period of time—years, in fact—and is not confined
to just one interview. That is, much can be and should be done
for the boy and the girl during the early school years to provide
them with information and firsthand experience with a variety
of kinds of work. A person can make a wise and intelligent
vocational choice only when he has had sufficient experience
and knowledge about a large enough variety of kinds of work,
d. Employment methods.
When we consider employment methods, we are con-
sidering the reverse aspect of the same general problem.
Here the industry is trying to find the best person for a
particular job. To do this, it is necessary to know first
what the job demands of the individual in the way of abilities,
education, personality, training, experience, etc.; then, to
have some way of appraising the applicants so as to discover
the person with the qualifications that most nearly fit
those demanded by the job.
Employment methods have been too often merely a kind.
of hit-or-miss, trial-and-error sort of procedure. Too often
employment officers have depended on the looks of the
applicant and answers to a few questions asked and a large
amount of just plain "hunch." But employment methods.
193


## p. 194 (#210) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
could be more adequate if more careful job analyses were
made and more reliable methods of sizing up the individual
were used. The usual letter of application tells very little
about the individual except that he can write and that he
writes a good or a poor letter. (It does not always tell even
this, if the applicant gets someone else to write it for him.)
And letters of recommendation are often not very reliable
or illuminating. Photographs of the applicant tell only what
he looks like and not what he can do or what kind of per-
sonality or character he possesses. An employment interview
is valuable to the extent that the interviewer is trained and
experienced in knowing what to look for and how to estimate
what he sees and hears. The danger here is that the inter-
viewer may develop some short cuts in which he has faith but
which do not furnish a reliable indication of the individual's
true personality or ability.
Efficient employment methods require considerable pre-
liminary work. To be able to pick out individuals for a job,
it is necessary first to know what the job requires. This
calls for a thorough job analysis, which includes an accurate
picture of what is actually done on the job and an analysis
of these activities in terms of the basic abilities and aptitudes
and personality traits involved. When such a job analysis
has been made, the next step is to devise ways and means
of assessing the applicants, to see whether they possess
these abilities, skills, and characteristics. More and more
standardized tests are being used to do this; but these tests,
to be of value, must be tested by trying them out on the
people on the job, to see whether they actually do select the
individuals who are the most successful and those that are
least successful. Tests not carefully constructed and tested
may be misleading and inaccurate.
3. VOCATIONAL ADJUSTMENT
Selecting the right person for the job and the right job
for the person is an important part of vocational adjust-

ment, but not the whole story. A survey of any large indus-
trial or commercial establishment will indicate that many
workers are discontented and far from happy in their jobs.
Wages and hours of work are only two of many causes of
discontent, and perhaps not the most important. The highly
specialized nature of modern work methods has made it
more difficult for the worker to obtain satisfaction of his
desire to create. He sometimes cannot see how what he does
fits into the larger picture, and he is denied any feeling of
achievement. Also, there is a tendency toward monotony,
with its unpleasant feelings of boredom and restlessness.
Frequently, too, the worker fails to feel any self-importance
in his work. He is merely a cog in a complicated machine.
An examination of the wants of the worker indicates
how some of the above causes of job dissatisfaction and
unrest are being expressed and shows also how it may be
possible to counteract their effect.
a. The workers want management to demonstrate an in-
terest in them as persons, not just mechanisms of production.
b. The workers want a chance to discuss with the boss not
only their grievances but also the whole work situation, with
some assurance that their ideas will receive consideration.
c. The workers want a voice in determining the nature
of the policies of the company directly affecting their welfare
and status.
d. The workers want to feel that there is complete fairness.
in all disciplinary action.
e. The workers want a chance to grow on the job, to feel
that there is a chance for advancement and that promotion
is given for merit.
f. The workers want the conditions of work made suitable
for self-respecting human beings, with reasonable hours of
work and facilities for their comfort and recreation.
g. The workers want credit for good work and clear in-
structions as to what is expected of them and constructive
suggestions for improvement.
195


## p. 196 (#212) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
h. The workers want opportunities to contribute to
efficient production, a chance to make suggestions and to
see the suggestions carried out, or to be shown why these
are not feasible.
i. The workers want some assurance of future security,
so that there can be some feeling of permanence in the job.
j. The workers want their future assured by pension plans
and by unemployment, sickness, and accident insurance.
k. The workers want living conditions that are com-
fortable housing, transportation, and educational and
recreational facilities.
•
These wants are universal among workers, and, unless
they are met in some way, job satisfaction and a high level
of efficiency are impossible. Above all, the worker wants
to be thought of and treated as an individual with feelings,
ideas, desires, and ambitions. Good morale is possible only
when he feels that he is important and accepted in a group
which has a purpose that all are cooperating to fulfill.

MENTAL HYGIENE AND
Chapter XIV
SANE LIVING
M
ENTAL health, like physical health, is a blessed heritage
and should be fostered and maintained. During the
last hundred years, people have become not only interested
but much better informed about the principles of physical
health and hygiene. A corresponding development is only
just beginning in the field of mental hygiene, although the
problem has been just as acute and important.
It has been said that mental illness is increasing. Whether
or not this is true is hard to determine. Certainly there are
more patients in mental hospitals today than there ever
were before; but this is because there is more accommodation
for them than previously, and also because there is an
increased confidence in mental hospitals. At the present time,
there are about as many beds for mental patients as for
physical disorders and there could be more. Another reason
why mental illness seems to be on the increase is that there
are improved facilities and methods for early diagnosis
of mental illness and so more cases are discovered than
previously.
There are a number of common misapprehensions about
mental illness that should be guarded against, because they
have retarded progress. Many think of mental illness as a
disgrace, to be hidden at all costs; but there is no more reason
why mental illness should be considered a disgrace than
why measles or an operation for appendicitis should be
thought of as disgraceful. Perhaps people have thought of
mental illness as a disgrace because they have thought of
mental illness being inherited and, therefore, an indication
of a family weakness. However, many kinds of mental illness
198


## p. 199 (#215) ############################################

MENTAL HYGIENE AND SANE LIVING
(and it should be remembered that there are many kinds of
mental disorder) are not at all the result of heredity but are
caused by a maladjustment built up during the lifetime of
the individual. Another common idea about mental illness
that is not true is that it is sudden in onset-that the
person
is well and of sound mind one day, and the next day he is
crazy. However, it has been shown that most mental illness
has a long history of development, taking years to build
up to the point where the person is unable to carry on happily
and efficiently. Many indications of developing mental
illness are evident years before the individual is considered
to be ill enough to be sent to a mental hospital. Another
common error in thinking about mental illness is the idea
that all mentally ill people are dangerous and may do bodily
harm to anyone who comes into their path. This is far from
being true, as most mentally ill individuals are not at all
dangerous. There are a few who are, but these are the excep-
tion, not the rule. Nor is mental illness incurable, as many
people seem to think. Indeed, a large percentage of the
patients in mental hospitals are cured and can return to
normal living again.
In this chapter we will not be concerned with the more
extreme phases of mental disorder but will consider mainly
a program of mental hygiene for the individual-a program
designed to help him to build up and maintain a good mental
health. Such a program is not merely to prevent men-
tal illness, although that is a part of it, but also to help
strengthen and even better the mental health of the normal
person.
Good mental health has as its basis or foundation a feeling
of security. This feeling is, in turn, based on a true self-
confidence that makes the individual feel that he "belongs,"
that he is "at home" in his world; that he is wanted, has a
place, and is important. This feeling of security, of belonging,
comes when the individual has learned enough to be able
to adjust to most of the everyday situations in which he
199


## p. 200 (#216) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
finds himself. It is a feeling that banishes apprehension,
fear, and strain and enables the person to use his intelligence
to deal with his problems and difficulties. In other words,
mental health is not the absence of problems and difficulties,
but rather an ability to deal with these problems in a satisfy-
ing and effective manner. For example, a person can escape
from making social blunders if he goes off by himself and
never comes in contact with anyone else, but by so doing,
even though he rids himself of any problems of social adjust-
ment, he also robs himself of the satisfactions of a normal
human life. The mentally healthy individual has learned
how to adjust satisfactorily in a world with other people.
He has acquired social skills and a knowledge of people
that makes him feel at home in a social world and, at the
same time, banishes his fears of making social blunders.
The goal of life for most people is the attainment of
happiness and contentment; yet happiness seems to be an
elusive goal, difficult for most people to attain. About a
quarter of the employees of any large mercantile establish-
ment are what might be called problem cases. They are
repeatedly transferring from one job to another; they are
the so-called failures. Almost any classroom of school children
has at least one maladjusted child. The very prevalent unrest
and dissatisfaction is an indication that a great many people
find it difficult to adjust themselves to things as they are.
The majority of failures in work and life are due not to any
inaptitude or lack of ability but to a faulty attitude toward
oneself, toward one's work, or toward other people, or
toward life itself. With a careful study of individual cases,
most of these individuals can be adjusted; and with the
honest acceptance of a few basic principles, most of these
failures and maladjustments could be prevented.
We live in a very complicated social structure, a struc-
ture that makes many demands on the individual and
also imposes many restrictions on his conduct. Mental
health consists in making adequate and satisfying adjust-
200

ments to the many demands of this social environment.
The way in which an individual adjusts to life situations
is pretty much a matter of habit. He learns to adjust in
certain ways and this becomes habitual, so that he meets
the constantly changing situations of life in much the same
each time. Because the form of adjustment employed
by an individual is a matter of habit, there is some hope,
because what has been learned can be modified or unlearned
and other habits can be substituted.
way
We will think, then, of the problem of mental health
as a question of acquiring certain habits of adjustment.
Here, as in any learning situation, practice makes perfect.
It is possible for anyone to acquire certain very necessary
habits, such as habitual attitudes toward life and people-
habits of optimism, of making decisions promptly, and so
on-if he desires to do so and puts enough effort into his
attempts.
As we have already seen, the emotions of fear and anger
constitute disruptions in the regular adjustment. Fear is
caused by a loss of the feeling of security, or by anything
that tends to make life and habitual activities uncertain.
Anger, on the other hand, results from the thwarting or
obstruction of basic motives. The causes of fear and anger
run counter, then, to the mental health and happy adjust-
ment of the individual.
Fear results from a conscious inability to do anything
in a given situation. The individual worries (and worry
is a fear daydream) when he is unable to do anything about
the cause of the worry. As we have seen earlier, an emotional
state is a condition of preparation for action, the physiologi-
cal functions being such that strenuous activity is not only
possible but required. When fear is present, activity of some
kind is desirable. The first suggestion in a program of per-
sonal mental hygiene would be, then, to make an attempt to
adjust to situations that threaten security, by being active.
The antidote for worry is action. If you fear tomorrow and

event. A certain
amount of intelligent planning is, of course, necessary; but,
aside from this, bridges should not be crossed before they are
reached. The habit of expecting the worst not only puts a
heavy strain on the individual but usually influences the
happening when it does occur; that is, you expect to fail,
not to do well, and this worry may condition your activity
in such a way that your expectations will come true. More-
over, mental health requires that the individual shall have
acquired the habit of making the best out of a present situa-
tion and then, when it is over, accepting as a matter of fact
the consequences, whatever they may be, without regret.
Worry about the future and regret about the past can only
arouse strains and stresses, tensions and emotional upsets,
about which nothing can be done. Mental health requires
202


## p. 203 (#219) ############################################

that you live one day at a time, with no habits of worry and
habits of regretting. How can you help worrying? Well,
worry is a habit and, like all habits, can be broken by a
systematic substitution of another habit in its place.
Mental ill-health comes from fear and apprehension
and loss of the feeling of security, but these can be mini-
mized by sharing them with others. Fear when it is brought
out into the open and discussed, usually vanishes in thin air;
while fear cooped up within the experience of the individual
is disturbing and unhealthy. There is considerable help
in the realization that we are members of a social group,
that everything does not depend on us alone, and that
responsibilities can be shared with others.
The searchlight of logic, when it is turned on the fears and
worries of everyday life, shows that most fears are useless. A
little intelligent reasoning often reveals that we are worrying
and fearing without cause. Many times we would find, if we
would only stop to examine things, that what we are worrying
about is not worth the effort. Most fears are groundless; all
fear is useless; and fear seldom fails to be harmful.
There is a very close relationship between physical health
and mental health. In fact, careful study shows that much
so-called sickness can be directly traced to mental causes.
Research has revealed that much indigestion, as well as
other stomach and intestinal trouble, is due to worry.
Emotional disturbance includes physical disturbance. Diges-
tion stops entirely under the influence of strong emotion.
Mental experience affects physical health, and physical
health reacts on experience. Sound mental health depends
on sound physical health, and physical health in turn de-
pends on mental health. The person who is in good physical
health has a much smaller chance of becoming mentally ill.
Sufficient sleep, rest, recreation, and exercise in the open
air, all contribute to a sound mind in a sound body.
A further source of strain and tensions is the thwarting
of our actions. Difficulties, problems, obstacles, or anything

that interferes with the easy fulfillment of our wishes may
be the cause of poor mental health. There are at least three
ways in which an individual can meet problems and obstacles.
He may become angry. He may give up and rationalize with
some such query as What's the use? Or he may attack the
problem in an intelligent, discovery-seeking attitude. Any
one of these methods may become the habitual activity of the
individual in the face of difficulty.
Obviously, the third method is the most healthy. Anger
is usually destructive of any chance for a useful adjustment
to the difficulty. Anger is not socially acceptable, is frowned
on by society, and is considered a childish way of meeting
difficulties; yet how often do adults fly into a rage when
thwarted! Giving up the outward battle and carrying on in
imagination only is a fruitless adjustment to obstacles.
But the habit of accepting the difficulty as an opportunity
to learn something or to make a new adjustment, as a
challenge to our abilities, is not only useful but basic to
mental health.
Contrast these three individuals with the same ability,
the same problem, and draw your own conclusion. One
stamps his feet in rage, stalks out of the room, slamming
the door, and takes a few days to "cool off" and become
ashamed of himself. Another, facing the same problem, says
"What's the use?" and goes off to sulk and tell himself
how hard life is and how unfair. The third meets the problem
with a cheerful attitude and goes to work to solve the
difficulty; he accepts it as a challenge to his intelligence
and, after persisting for a time, arrives at a happy solution
to the difficulty and goes his way looking for new worlds
to conquer. The difference between these individuals is a
difference in habitual forms of adjustment. Habits can be
formed and habits can be broken if the desire and intention
are strong enough.
Difficulties come to everyone; obstacles and problems
are the common lot of all humanity; but difficulties are

the steppingstones to real progress. As long as life goes
on in a routine way, with no problems, no obstacles, no
thwarting, there is no advance, no learning, no discovery,
and no progress. The realization, then, that frustration of
our wishes and normal course of action may be the chance
to discover something new, to take a new road, to get out
of the rut of ordinary activities, helps us not only to endure
such difficulties but even to welcome them.
In the hurry and stress of competitive activities of the
twentieth century, most people have lost the habit of living
easily. We hurry to get somewhere so that we can hurry
back again. The mental health of the individual depends to
a large extent on his sense of values. There are many things
that we strive for and worry about that are not worth the
effort. Even recreation has become work and the source of
tensions. If we could only pause long enough to get a glimpse
of ourselves, we might be able to laugh at ourselves, and the
laugh would do us good. The energy that is wasted on
dignity! Mental health requires a sense of values and a sense
of humor. Most of the things that make us irritated are not
worth the effort at all. Someone steps in front of us to get on
the streetcar, and the whole day may be spoiled for ourselves
and our associates. The coffee isn't just right at breakfast,
and the office staff had better beware what they do, that
day! What small, insignificant things we allow to dominate
our lives! A sense of values that places these incidents in
their proper place, and a sense of humor that enables us to
laugh at ourselves make all the difference between irritability,
strain, and mental ill-health, and a happy, easy adjustment to
life. Live easily. How lightly it is said; but how difficult is the
achievement, once we have built up habits of strain and rush.
Here, again, however, habits may be broken and other habits
substituted if there is strong enough determination.
Cheerfulness is an asset. It is a habit and, like all habits,
it can be acquired. Observe any situation where people are
thrown together in clubs and meetings, on streetcars, in

stores, and you will be forced to realize how much this is
needed. Not only is it valuable for happy social intercourse,
but it is needed for personal mental health. In these days,
it may be easy to be pessimistic, to be irritated at little or
nothing; but such habits are certainly detrimental to mental
health. It is not easy to change such habits when they are
long established. But here, as in any change of habits, it
can be accomplished. Practice makes perfect. It is possible
to substitute habits of cheerfulness for habits of pessimistic,
grouchy irritability, if we really want to do so.
Another very useful habit is what might be called the
experimental attitude toward life. "We have been whipping
John for five years and he is as bad as ever." "I've tried and
tried again and it's always the same; it doesn't work." How
often have we heard such statements! When some method of
doing things, some way of adjusting, doesn't work, why not
try something else? Old ways are always easy ways. New
ways and new experiments are always difficult. Perhaps this
is the key to the riddle. Perhaps this is the reason we go on
in old ways. Happiness depends on success, and success or
satisfaction comes more easily when we are open to new
methods and new thoughts.
To understand the suggestions given in this chapter is
easy, but to put these suggestions into effect is difficult.
It involves desire and persistent effort. Mental health does
not just happen; it requires practice and care; but the result
is worth almost any amount of effort.
In conclusion, we will list a number of principles of mental
hygiene, most of which have been discussed above.

KNOWING OUR WORLD
This final section of our study explores the technical
details of the process of “coming to know." It describes the
avenues of knowledge-the sense organs; the process of
observation, including attending and perceiving; the process
of learning; and also thinking and imagination.
Some of the questions to be answered are:
What are the sense organs and how do they function?
What are the characteristics of attention?
What are the stimuli that attract and direct attention?
What are the kinds of attention and how do they develop?
What is distraction and how can it be handled?
What are the fundamentals of perceiving?
What are the common errors in perceiving?
What are the important features of learning?
How is learning measured?
What are the factors affecting the efficiency of learning?
How can habits be broken?
What are the fundamentals of thinking?
What is a good reasoner like?
What is the place of imagination in human life?
How can thinking be improved?

THE SENSES AND
Chapter XV
SENSATIONS-THE
AVENUES OF
KNOWLEDGE
ALL
I. THE SENSE ORGANS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS
LL knowledge comes through the sense organs. The
individual finds out facts or discovers information by
observing with the sense organs and by thinking, or by
both together. As we shall see later, all the material of
thought comes through the sense-organ avenues, so that the
basis of all knowledge is the functioning of these organs.
In the most primitive animal, the one-celled amoeba,
there are no sense organs, but the whole animal is sensi-
tive. The same cell carries on the functions of receiving
stimulation and acting on it. However, in animals with
more than one cell there is a specialization of structure for
particular purposes. In the highest form of animal life, the
mammals, the process of specialization is very extensive, and
special organs have been developed for the purpose of receiv-
ing stimuli, conducting impulses, reacting, digesting, breath-
ing, and so on.
Each sense organ is like a delicate receiving and registering
instrument, an indicator of some particular force or energy.
The
eye, for instance, is so constructed that it is capable of
receiving and registering light waves, just as a radio receiving
set is made to receive and register waves in the ether. Each
sense organ is highly sensitive to a particular form of energy.
The sense organ for hearing is sensitive, for instance, to
sound waves but not to light waves. The sense cells them-
selves are not visible from the outside but lie within the
depth of the organ. Each sense organ is composed of the
sensory cells, a sensory nerve connecting these cells with
211


## p. 212 (#228) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
the central nervous system, and accessory apparatus to aid in
the efficient reception of sense impressions. The sensory cells
are connected by individual nerve fibers with the central
nervous system, and thus indirectly with every other part of
the body. It is through these connections that the stimulation
affecting a sense organ has an influence on the behavior of
the individual.
The characteristics of a sense organ may be summarized
as follows: (a) It is selective; that is, it responds to a certain
kind of stimulus and not to all kinds of stimuli. (b) It is sensi-
tive, so that it is capable of responding to even faint stimuli.
(c) It is graduated, so that it can respond differently to
different intensities of the stimulus. (d) It has the power of
differentiating between different qualities of the stimulus.
There are many more sense organs than the traditional
five. These organs are the only avenues through which
information regarding the external world, as well as the
condition of the organism itself, can enter the experience of
the individual. All knowledge originates from experience,
and all experience is dependent upon sensory impressions.
Because the functions of the sense organs is the reception
of stimuli, this system is generally called the receptor system.
A very useful classification of the receptors consists of
three divisions, namely, the exteroceptors, or receptors re-
ceiving stimulation from the exterior of the body; the
proprioceptors, receiving stimulation from gross movements
of the body; and interoceptors, receiving stimulation from the
visceral parts or internal organs of the body. The following
list indicates the main systems of sense organs according to
this classification:
Classification of receptors.

millions of sensory cells in the eye and an elaborate accessory

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
which is a transparent front surface of the eyeball. They pass
through the small opening in the iris, called the pupil. The
iris muscle controls the size of the pupil, which opens or
closes depending on the intensity of the light that strikes the
eye. Behind the pupil the light passes through the lens,
the function of which is to bring the light rays to a focus
on the sensitive surface of the retina. Changes in the shape of
the lens, brought about by the ciliary muscle, regulate the
focus for objects of varying distance from the eye. After the
light passes through the lens it continues on through a trans-
parent substance in the large cavity of the eye and finally
reaches the retina, which is the inner layer of the eyeball and
is composed of the actual sensory cells for vision. There
are millions of these little cells, some of which are called rods
and are stimulated by grays, while others, called cones,
mediate color sensations. Each one of these sensory cells
is connected by a nerve fiber with the optic nerve, which
runs back to end in the brain. The point directly behind the
pupil is called the fovea; this is the point of clearest vision,
containing cones in great abundance. The point where the
optic nerve leaves the eyeball is blind, as there are no rods
and cones at that point.
The effective stimulus for vision is provided, as has been
stated, by light waves of a certain frequency range. The eye
is sensitive to the intermediate range of wave lengths in
the light waves. Differences in the wave length of the light
stimulus produce differences in the hue of the resulting
sensation. Brightness is related to the energy of the light,
and saturation to the purity of the light waves.
Visual sensations may be classified into two series: a
brightness series and a color series. The brightness series
varies from white to black. Every visual sensation can be
said to have a certain brightness value; that is, it can be
placed somewhere in the brightness series. The color-tone
series can be arranged roughly in a circle, with the four
primary colors-red, yellow, blue, and green-spaced around
214


## p. 215 (#231) ############################################

SENSES AND SENSATIONS-AVENUES OF KNOWLEDGE
this circle. Starting at red on the color circle and working
toward yellow, we can fill in the spaces with the different
orange shades, which are combinations of red and yellow.
Continuing on beyond the yellow on the circle, we have
greenish yellow and yellowish green to pure green, then bluish
green and greenish blue to pure blue. Past the blue we come to
the violet hues running into purples; finally, as the purples
become more red, we complete the circle and have returned
to the red again. A third series may be formed with each hue.
This is the saturation series, ranging from a fully saturated
red, for instance, to a very faint pink, all members of the
series having the same hue and brightness. The three ways,
therefore, in which a visual sensation may vary are in bright-
ness, in hue or color tone, and in saturation; and every visual
sensation may be described in terms of these three variables.
Some indication of the functioning of the visual sensations
may be obtained from a review of a number of simple
experiments.
a. Color mixing.
Every light wave in the visible range produces some
specific color hue. There are about 160 distinguishable color
tones. Every hue except the four primary colors can be pro-
duced by mixing light waves on a color wheel. If we place
on the color wheel a red and a yellow disk and rotate the
wheel rapidly, the resulting sensation is orange, which is a
blend. If we mix blue with yellow, the resulting sensation
is gray; and these colors are called complementary hues.
The colors opposite each other on our color circle are com-
plementary to each other; that is, they produce a gray
sensation when mixed in this way. All other mixtures.
produce color blends.
b. Aftersensations.
If you look intently at an intense stimulus, such as a
light bulb, and then close the eyes, the sensation persists.
215


## p. 216 (#232) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
This is called a positive afterimage, or aftersensation. If,
again, you were to stare at a square red card for about half
a minute, then remove the card and look at a gray back-
ground, a square of green would appear, this being a nega-
tive afterimage, green being the complementary color to
the original red.
c. Adaptation.
When one enters a dark room from the bright sunlight, at
first nothing is seen, but after a time the objects in the room
become visible. The eyes have become dark adapted. If
now the reverse process occurs, leaving the dark room for
the bright out-of-doors, at first the light is dazzling, but
after a time the eyes become light adapted and vision
becomes clear again. If you were to put on a pair of red-
colored glasses, at first everything would seem to be a vivid
red; but, if the glasses are worn for a period of time, the vivid
red fades out and everything appears natural again. Sud-
denly remove the red glasses, and everything will have a
greenish tinge.
d. Color blindness.
About 4 per cent of all men and about 14 of 1 per cent of
all women are color blind to a certain extent. Color blind-
ness is not a disease but an inherited defect in the color
apparatus of the eye. It is not at present curable. Total
color blindness is very rare and amounts to brightness vision
only. Partial color blindness, or red-green blindness, accounts
for nearly all color-blind individuals, who have yellow and
blue color sensations, as well as the brightness series, but no
red or green. Often such a person is not aware of his defect.
He has difficulty at times in selecting neckties or other
colored items of wearing apparel, in obeying the red and
green traffic lights, in picking strawberries, and in other
situations where red and green may be confused by one who
is unable to distinguish them. There are a number of very
216

SENSES AND SENSATIONS AVENUES OF KNOWLEDGE
good color-blindness tests, which are valuable in selecting
candidates for positions that require an ability accurately to
distinguish red and green; for example, locomotive engineers
or dress designers. Some of these tests make use of colored
yarns; others, of cards with cleverly arranged figures in
different hues; and still others, of colored lights.
Out of a number of theories of vision that have been
suggested, we will mention briefly only one. Hering's theory
assumes that there are three specialized structures, or
mechanisms, in the eye. These three substances are the
black-white substance, the red-green substance, and the blue-
yellow substance. When the eye is stimulated with blue,
for instance, there is a chemical change in the yellow-
blue substance that gives rise to a sensation of blue. When
the blue stimulus is removed, the blue-yellow substance
tends to return to normal and this causes a negative after-
sensation of yellow. The red-green color-blind individual
lacks the red-green substance in his visual apparatus. This
theory explains very well the facts of color mixing, after-
sensations, and color blindness.
One of the most important functions of the eye is to dis-
tinguish spatial forms and patterns. The eye sees only
when it is not in motion. For example, when a person is
reading, his eyes take a series of jumps and pauses along
the line of print, and it is during the pauses only that the
visual impression is made. When one is looking at a scene
the same thing is taking place, the eyes are jumping from
one feature of the scene to another and visual sensations
result while the eye is at rest. The eye moves so fast and
there is so slight a lag in the sensations that we are not
conscious of any blurring or period of no impression. This
fact of the lag of visual sensations is utilized in the motion
picture, where one picture follows another so quickly that
the eye has not time to recover during the interval. The
succeeding pictures are slightly different, so that the illusion
of motion is produced.
217


## p. 218 (#234) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
The two eyes work together. Binocular vision has certain
advantages over monocular vision. There is, first, the factor
of reinforcement; that is, the binocular sensation is slightly
more intense than a monocular sensation. In near vision,
more is seen of the object with two eyes than with one, the
right eye seeing farther around to the right and the left eye
farther to the left, so that the solid object is seen more com-
pletely with two eyes than the one only. The most important
value of binocular vision is in the perception of depth, or
the third dimension. The two eyes receive slightly different
pictures, and the combination or fusion of these two slightly
different pictures produces the illusion of depth. This
principle of slightly dissimilar impressions is utilized in the
stereoscope.
3. AUDITORY SENSITIVITY
The sense organs for hearing are situated in the cochlea
of the inner ear. Vibrations in the air, which constitute
the effective stimuli for audition, are collected by the outer
ear and transmitted through the auditory canal to the
tympanic membrane or eardrum. When this membrane
is set in motion, the vibrations are carried by a set of three
tiny bones to another membrane in the cochlea, which, in
turn, sets in motion the liquid in the inner ear; finally,
this vibration affects the hair cells, which are the sensory
cells for hearing. These little hair cells are tuned to different
rates of vibration and constitute the mechanism that
differentiates the different sounds.
The stimulus for audition is a restricted range of wave
lengths in the air-from about 18 vibrations per second to
about 50,000 per second. These vibrations vary in several
ways-in wave length, in the amplitude of the wave, and
in the complexity of the vibrating wave. Each of them
is related to a particular quality of the resulting sensation.
Auditory sensations may be roughly classified into tones.
and noises, tones being relatively smooth while noises are
218


## p. 219 (#235) ############################################

SENSES AND SENSATIONS-AVENUES OF KNOWLEDGE
irregular. These sensations differ in pitch, depending on
the wave length of the stimulus; in loudness, depending
on the amplitude of the wave; and in timbre, depending
on the complexity of the wave motion. Timbre is the char-
acteristic sound of the different sources of sound that enables
us to tell whether the sound originates from a human voice,
a piano, or some other instrument, even when the pitch and
loudness of the various sounds are the same.
4. OLFACTORY SENSITIVITY
The sense organ for smell is located in the upper nasal
cavity. The actual sense organs are small hairlike cells
connected, of course, with sensory nerves. The stimulus
for smell consists of particles in the air carried by air currents
into the nose. The salient olfactory sensations have been
determined as follows: fruity, flowery, spicy, resinous,
smoky, and putrid. One very prominent characteristic of
the olfactory modality is the factor of sensory adaptation.
When the sense cells for smell have been assailed by any
particular odor for a period of time, they become adapted
and that particular odor is no longer perceived. Olfactory
sensations are closely bound up with taste sensations and
a large part of what is usually called taste is really the action
of this sense modality. Outside the function of smell in the
taste of foods, olfactory sensations play only a very slight
part in the life of human beings, although this is one of the
most important sense modalities in lower animals.
5. GUSTATORY SENSITIVITY
The sense organs for taste are located on the upper surface
of the tongue and in certain regions in the back of the throat.
The sense organs are the taste buds, which are situated in
little grooves in these regions. The stimulus for taste is
substances in solution. In order that any object may be
tasted, it must be in solution so that it may penetrate into
these little grooves and thus affect the taste buds. There

are four elementary

and
sensations from other sense modalities. If the olfactory sensa-
tions are excluded, the taste of a potato and an onion are almost
identical. In the taste of most food, odor is more important
than actual taste sensations. Cutaneous sensations, heat
and cold, and the hardness and softness of foods all con-
tribute to the combined "taste" of foods.
6. CUTANEOUS SENSITIVITY
There are many kinds of sensation received from the skin.
By means of the sense organs in the skin we are able to dis-
criminate between rough and smooth, hot and cold, itching
and tickling, pricking and stinging, moist and dry, as well
as to sense touch, shape, hardness and softness, and many
other varieties of skin sensitivity. Careful experiments have
demonstrated that all skin sensitivity can be analyzed into
220


## p. 221 (#237) ############################################

SENSES AND SENSATIONS-AVENUES OF KNOWLEDGE
four kinds of elementary sensation qualities-touch, warm,
cold, and pain. All other sensations are blends of these.
These four elementary sensations may be distinguished
by means of a little experiment. Map out a small area of the
skin and explore this area with a fine instrument. It will
be found that there are certain fairly well-defined spots
that give a definite sensation of touch, while other places
on the skin do not. Do the same with a cold instrument and
again with a hot instrument. If the different spots are
charted, it will be found that the touch spots differ from the
warm spots, which again differ from the cold spots. These
four kinds of skin sensations have sense organs that are
separate and distinct.
7. STATIC SENSITIVITY
The sense organ for equilibrium is in the semicircular
canals of the inner ear. These sense organs are stimulated
by movements of the head. They are essential in the main-
tenance of bodily equilibrium in all movements of the
body. When these sensations become too intense, they
constitute dizziness.
8. KINESTHETIC SENSITIVITY
In each muscle, tendon, and joint, there are sense organs
that are aroused by movements of the muscles, tendons, or
joints. The resulting sensations are called kinesthetic sensa-
tions, or sensations of movement. This sense modality is
extremely important in any activity involving the move-
ments of the limbs, and without it the complex coordinations
involved in walking, writing, manipulation, and so on, would
be impossible. Kinesthetic sensations are necessary in judg-
ments of distance and depth by the eye, in the intricate
muscular movements required for speech, and, in fact, in any
activity that involves accuracy of muscular movement.
221


## p. 222 (#238) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
9. ORGANIC SENSITIVITY
Sense organs running into the millions are to be found
in the inner linings of the body. We know very little about
these, as yet; but we do know that they serve the very
important function of making us aware of the condition of
the various internal organs of the body. Sensations of
hunger, thirst, faintness, nausea, and suffocation are a few
of the varieties of the organic sensations. Pains of various
kinds also originate from these sense organs. Such organic
sensations, sometimes very vague and indefinite, contribute
in great part to the feeling tone, the mood, and even the
train of thought of the individual. These organic sensations
are indicators of bodily condition and are thus directors of
action. They are at the basis of the appetites, which were dis-
cussed in an earlier chapter.
IO. SENSATIONS AND ACTIVITY
The individual becomes acquainted with the world in
which he lives through the sense-organ avenues; but sensa-
tions serve a larger purpose than merely to give the individual
information about the world. Sensations initiate activity
and also direct activity after it is started. They are stimuli
to action. They are conditions requiring some form of adjust-
ment on the part of the individual. The precision of muscu-
lar movement is possible only by the guidance of the eye,
the muscle sense, and the sense of equilibrium. In the next
chapter we will trace the sensations in their influence on
activity. Sensations are meaningless in themselves; but,
when they acquire meaning in perception, they become
the basis of the adjustment of the individual to an objective
world.
Sensations have their place in the experience of the
individual aside from their function as the origin of knowl-
edge. They are utilized in the aesthetic appreciation of art

and music. The life of feeling and emotion is also based on
sensations. We might go so far as to say that sensations are
the groundwork of all experience and activity.

OBSERVATION—
ATTENTION AND
PERCEPTION
B
I. INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT
EFORE any sensory experience becomes knowledge
there are several other stages needed besides mere
sensory impression. Knowing usually involves an act of
attending. Attention may be defined as a preliminary act of
adjustment on the part of the individual that is conducive
to a more effective knowledge of the object. Objects and
events, when attended to, become clearer and more dis-
tinct in the consciousness of the individual. Attention to
an object renders that object a more effective stimulus
to action. The next stage is that of perceiving. When an
individual attends to a sensory stimulation, he recalls
from previous experience information bearing on the present
situation, and thus ascribes meaning to the stimulation
and perceives the stimulus as an object or event with mean-
ing or significance for action.
Another feature of knowing is remembering, which is
the process of reviving past experiences in such a way that
they have significance in the present situation. In any act of
knowing, the past experience of the individual plays a part by
giving the present sensory impression a significance in terms
of previous experiences with like stimulation.
Thinking is another process in knowing. Thinking is
the manipulation of experiences into new patterns and
forms. Imagining is one kind of mental manipulation in
which experiences are combined into novel configurations.
Reasoning is another form of thinking, in which an inference
is the final result of the mental manipulation. Conceiving
is the process of divorcing experiences from particular

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
situations and is, thus, thinking in general terms or in terms
of principles.
All these stages or types of knowing are bound up together,
so that any one act of knowing may include all or most of
them. For purposes of discussion, we have separated these
stages and processes; but it should be kept in mind that in
actual life these stages are not separate and distinct by any
means.
In order to make these rather vague remarks more con-
crete, let us look at an example of the functioning of the
various stages and processes in knowing. Suppose that we
take as our example robbery. It is fairly obvious what we ⚫
mean by attending to and perceiving a robbery. In that
case, we are actually present as the robbery takes place.
We concentrate our attention on the event as it takes place.
The sensory impressions become perceptions as we give
meaning to them by means of past knowledge. Sensory
impressions become perceptions of a man with a mask and a
revolver telling the bank clerks to hold up their hands and
then scooping up the money. This combination of sensory
impressions, plus the interpretation that we are able to put
on them because of past experience, leads us to say "It's
a holdup."
To remember a robbery implies that sometime in the
past we actually perceived a robbery, and now we recall
it as an event that took place at a particular time and in a
particular place. The accuracy of the memory depends
on the accuracy of the original perception, plus the reten-
tion of the experience and the ability to recall it. Thinking
about a robbery may take a number of forms. We may reason
it out as follows: We come home from our summer vacation
and find that the cellar window is broken, that the furniture
is not as we left it, and that the silver and jewelry are missing.
From these pieces of information we infer that a robbery
has taken place, even though we did not perceive it or
remember it.
226


## p. 227 (#243) ############################################

OBSERVATION- -ATTENTION AND PERCEPTION
We might imagine a robbery by putting together expe-
riences and forming a new pattern. The materials of our
imagination we get from past experience, but the final result
is something that has never occurred. To form a conception
of a robbery, we think of robbery not in any particular
place or at any particular time; nor do we think of any
particular kind of robbery, but merely of robbery in general,
or activity defined as taking things that do not belong to
one.
2. THE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF THE ATTENDING
RESPONSE
Attending to an object implies a number of things.
It means, first, a motor response that brings the stimulation
from the object into as clear a focus as possible. The attentive
attitude is characteristically that of tense immobility. All
restless, random movements cease, and the whole body is
oriented toward the source of the stimulation.
An audience that is attending to a speaker is not restless;
in fact, nothing is heard but the words of the speaker; all
eyes are directed toward the platform, and the members
of the audience are literally sitting on the edge of their
seats. An inattentive audience, on the other hand, is
characterized by restless movements. Some are gazing out
the windows, others are fiddling with objects, while others
are leaning back in their seats in an attitude of relaxation.
Besides this motor attitude of tenseness, there are also sense
organ adjustments in attention. If it is visual attention,
the eyes are focused and directed; if it is tactual attention,
the object is manipulated so that the maximum of tactual
sensation may be received.
What we attend to controls our behavior, and what
we get other people to attend to controls their behavior.
The whole process of obtaining knowledge or information
depends on attention. Our memory of any experience is
conditioned directly by the degree of attention that is
given. The person who is unable to remember the names
227


## p. 228 (#244) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
of others whom he meets is one who does not attend closely
to a name as he hears it. The training of memory can be
achieved almost entirely in terms of practice in attention..
What we attend to determines what we react to. Attention
implies the reception of stimuli that will direct our activity.
It is equally true that the direction of the activity of other
people can be achieved through the direction of their atten-
tion. Advertising and display have been recognized as one
means of directing the buying of a nation. Attitudes, opin-
ions, and beliefs are formed when we can get people to attend
to what we wish. Half the battle in selling life insurance is
won when the salesman gets his prospect to attend to the
pertinent features of the situation. We control the education
of our children by arranging what they will attend to. We
fail sometimes in this endeavor because we fail to take
into account all the things that attract the attention of the
children. The maladjusted boy who appears in juvenile
court is there because he has attended to the wrong things,
and often because we have failed to fill his attention with
enough worth-while things.
3. KINDS OF STIMULI THAT ATTRACT ATTENTION
It is impossible to attend to everything. Attention is
by its very nature a selective process. What determines the
direction of attention? Of the many factors contributing
to the direction of attention, we shall be able to mention
only the more prominent.
For purposes of discussion, we may divide the stimuli
for attention into two classes-the objective and the sub-
jective factors. By "objective factors" we mean those
features of objects and events that attract attention, irrespec-
tive of volition and learning. By "subjective factors" is
meant those features that are dependent on the condition
of the individual himself.
The objective factors determining the direction of atten-
tion are those features of the environmental stimuli that
228


## p. 229 (#245) ############################################

OBSERVATION
-ATTENTION AND PERCEPTION
seem to have the power of attracting the attention of both
the child and the adult, irrespective of any learning or even
desire on the part of the individual. (a) Changing stimuli
tend to attract and hold the attention. Any main street
in a city or town offers an example of this feature-the
ever-changing electric-light signs command attention with
their continual change. We sit in a room reading and sud-
denly our attention is called to the fact that the clock has
stopped. It had been ticking along without attracting our
attention, but the stopping of the regular ticking sound is
adequate to attract our attention. (b) Intense stimulation
demands attention. An intense or bright light, a loud sound,
a strong odor capture and hold the attention much more
surely than dim lights, low sounds, or indistinct odors.
(c) Constant repetition of the same stimulus eventually
attracts the attention. (d) The unusual or the novel is another
objective feature that is powerful in directing the attention.
(e) Objects definite in form and outline are more likely to
attract the attention than are objects that are indistinct and
indefinite. (f) Objects that are related to basic needs or
appetites are usually attended to. Objects pertaining to
basic sensory needs, such as hunger, thirst, heat, cold, and
relief from pain, have powerful factors on their side in the
competition for the attention of the individual.
The tremendous dominance of immediate sensory ex-
perience over attention was, of course, of value to primitive
man in his continual struggle for existence in a world of
ever-present dangers. Even for the highly civilized man of
modern times these objective features of stimulation, change,
intensity, novelty, etc., are powerful in directing attention.
and thus, indirectly, his activity. The immediate sensory
situation is the characteristic concern of the young child;
but even the sophisticated adult is also dominated to a large
extent by the same features.
Man is characteristically a learning animal. His activity
is being continually modified in the light of experience.
229


## p. 230 (#246) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
This is true of attention as well as of any other feature of
activity. In general, anything that seems worth while to the
individual attracts his attention; and he learns what to
consider worth while. So, with learning, the kinds of stimuli
that attract attention are increased, even though the primi-
tive type of attention mentioned in the former section is
never left behind. These features depending on learning and
experience we have called the subjective factors in the direc-
tion of attention.
(a) What the individual is doing at the time conditions
what he will pay attention to. Stimuli that have a bearing
on this activity in progress direct attention toward them-
selves. (b) Present desire also dictates the direction of
attention. The individual who desires a new car attends to
the cars as they pass. The woman who feels the need of a
new hat looks in all the millinery-store windows as she walks
down the street. (c) Interest is another powerful dictator in
the realm of attention. It is a well-known fact that different
people see different things in the same scene. A farmer, an
artist, a real estate man, and a botanist standing on a hill
together and looking out over the land actually perceive
different things, because they attend to different aspects
of the situation, depending on their interests. (d) The
emotion or mood of the moment also directs the attention.
The pessimist sees nothing but ruin, while the optimist
sees a glorious future. The young man in love attends only
to the good features of his ladylove, while the young lady's
rival attends to rather different features in the same person.
(e) Fashion is a powerful director of attention. What "every-
body" is doing or saying demands attention and commands
action. Social suggestion is a powerful stimulus to attention
and action. (f) Imagined situations direct the attention to
anything that is related. Imagine that you would like to be
a well-educated person or a beautiful one or the possessor
of an attractive personality, and your attention will be
directed to the advertisements that seem to make these

OBSERVATION-ATTENTION AND PERCEPTION
imagined experiences possible. (g) You can build up habits of
attention to certain kinds of objects and inattention to
others. These habits are built up because of some of the
factors already mentioned-interest, fashion, necessity-
but, once established, they are very powerful in directing
the attention.
To revert to what we said at the beginning of this section,
attention directs action. To educate oneself, it is necessary
to develop interest and desires that will, in turn, direct one's
attention and thus produce the first essential of knowledge.
To influence other people in any line of action requires
making use of stimuli that are effective in capturing their
attention. If a person is interested, he is attentive. If interest
is not present, then the next best thing is to manipulate the
stimuli so as to capture the attention through the objective
factors mentioned above.
4. IMPORTANT FEATURES OF ATTENDING
Attention is a shifting process. It is impossible to attend
to one simple stimulus for any length of time. Most objects
are complex, and the mobile, shifting nature of attention
results in one feature being attended to for a short time
and then the attention shifting to other features. Attention
can be given to only one thing at a time. Most of the examples
of attending to a number of things at once can be explained
on the basis of the shifting of the attention from one thing
to another rapidly. There is a limit to the span or duration
of attention. Young children are unable to attend to any
one thing for any length of time, but with age the span of
attention increases. This increase is due to training or the
formation of habits of attention. There is also a limit to the
number of stimuli that can be apprehended in one act of
attention. The fundamental nature of the attending re-
sponse is exploration. Because attention is mobile, we are
able to explore the environment and discover those things
that are of significance for the activity of the moment.

5. KINDS OF ATTENTION AND HOW THEY DEVELOP
We may distinguish three kinds of attention and trace
their development in the life of the individual. The first
kind we will call random attention. This is characteristically
attention without effort and is involuntary. This is the most
primitive form of attention. It is determined by the stimulus
itself, and the features of the stimuli that are responsible for
it were mentioned above as the objective factors that attract
and hold the attention. It is unlearned and is the characteris-
tic attention of the young child. This kind of attention is not
sustained for any length of time, because as soon as any new
stimulus occurs the attention shifts. There is no goal or

purpose present and no real interest in the object that
attracts the attention.
The second kind of attention and the second stage in the
development of sustained attention is the forced, voluntary
attention that is given with conscious effort; it is usually
imposed on the individual by some extraneous motive, such
as reward or punishment. This is the kind of attention that is
predominantly unpleasant, forced, and unnatural. It is the
characteristic attention of the school child whose interest in
schoolwork has not been aroused, but who attends to the
task at hand because of the switch at the back of the teacher.
It is costly in terms of effort, because, desire and interest
being absent, the individual has to force himself to attend.
233


## p. 234 (#250) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
It is productive of strains and stresses, because there are
usually conflicting tendencies present in the individual. The
child is forcing himself to attend to something because of
fear or because of the desire to win approval; but his desires
and inclinations are elsewhere. When the worker is not
happy in his work and forces himself to attend to his task,
the attention comes with effort and sometimes at the cost of
his mental and physical health. It is very doubtful whether
the so-called discipline of forcing oneself to do the undesir-
able is worth the effort. An old theory of education and child
training suggests that it is necessary to force children to do
uninteresting and undesirable tasks because it is good for
them to thus discipline themselves. This old theory has to
give place to newer knowledge, which goes deeper and shows
that it is much more efficient to create an interest in the
activity itself than to force the individual to take part in an
activity in the hope that a habit of doing it will be formed.
This leads us to the third kind of attention, or the third
stage in the development of attention.
The most economical and efficient kind of attention is the
spontaneous attention that follows real interest in the thing
itself. This kind of attention is effortless, or at least there is
not the feeling of strain or effort that characterized the
former type. The individual is interested in the activity, so
there is no costly effort and no conflict with desires. It is a
fruitful kind of attention. It is the kind that the school child
gives to his work when he is really interested in it and is not
doing it merely because of fear of punishment or social dis-
approval. We will call this attention spontaneous, and we find
that the directing influences are goals and purposes. This is
the characteristic attention of the well-adjusted worker.
6. INATTENTION
As long as the individual is conscious, he is always attend-
ing to something, so that inattention is really attending to the
wrong things. When we say that the child is inattentive at
234


## p. 235 (#251) ############################################

OBSERVATION-ATTENTION AND PERCEPTION
school, we mean that he is attending to something that is
outside the school routine. He may be attending to his own
thoughts of a game of baseball that he is to play, or of the
swimming pool where he wishes he might be; or he may be
attending to the clouds passing by the school window. The
absent-minded individual is inattentive because he is very
attentive to something else. About all that can be said of
inattention is that it is attention directed toward something
other than the task or the matter at hand.
Sustained attention is the attention given to an object
or task for a considerable length of time. It is usually the
result of an interest in the event or the task itself. It is a
simple matter to arrange conditions so that an individual's
attention will be captured by some feature of the situation;
but, because of the shifting nature of attention, it is more
difficult to keep that attention directed for any length of
time.
The attention that is given with effort, because of fear
or mere politeness, is usually unpleasant; but attention that
is given because of real interest in the subject itself is not
only pleasant but also fruitful. This is the secret of capturing
and holding the attention of others. If the individual's
interest is aroused, his attention can be sustained.
7. DISTRACTION
A distraction may be defined as any stimulus that does
not fit in with the line of the thought or purpose of the
moment. A stimulus, to be a distraction to sustained atten-
tion, must have features in itself that are strong enough to
redirect the attention of the individual. Random attention
is easily distracted, and so is voluntary attention; but spon-
taneous attention is much more difficult to distract.
Distractions can be overcome in a number of ways. One
very common way of overcoming distraction is to put more
energy into the task itself. Mistakes and lack of efficiency
235


## p. 236 (#252) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
in any
task may be due to inability to do better, but they
are usually caused by distractions. More energy may be
poured into an activity by the stimulation of more interest
in the task itself. If this is impossible, the next best thing is to
increase the motivation by artificial means, such as rewards
or bonuses. Workers who have been working along at one
level of efficiency for years have been known to increase their
output materially when a bonus was offered for increased
speed. The effect of distractions and of overcoming distrac-
tions may be illustrated by an experiment that was tried
with typists. The efficiency of these typists was measured in
terms of the amount of output both with and without con-
trolled distractions. It was found that in most cases the type-
writing under distraction was even faster than that without
the distractions. When the amount of effort put into the task
was measured by recording the amount of pressure on the
keys, it was found that the keys were struck much more
heavily under conditions of distraction than at other times.
This indicates that distractions may be overcome by in-
creased effort. The more effort is put into most tasks, the
more permanent is the impression made; so that, in learning
situations, distractions may even serve to promote efficiency.
However, this may be rather costly in terms of fatigue.
Another method of overcoming the effect of distractions is
to build up habits of inattention to the distracting stimuli.
When an individual moves into a house on a streetcar line, at
first the noise of the streetcars is very noticeable and dis-
tracting, but in time the individual learns to disregard the
noise altogether, and the distraction loses its effectiveness.
This is the process of negative adaptation.
8. THE NATURE OF PERCEIVING
Perceiving may be defined as coming to know a present
object in relation to some act of adjustment. Human activity
is a succession of adjustments. A process of perceiving is
involved in most acts of adjustment. Perceiving includes a
236


## p. 237 (#253) ############################################

OBSERVATION- -ATTENTION AND PERCEPTION
stimulating situation, a preliminary attentive adjustment
toward it, and the arousal of the meaning or significance of
the stimulus in reference to what is being done or some con-
templated mode of reaction. Chapter XV outlined the kinds
of stimulation, and the preceding section treated the atten-
tive response, so all that remains to discuss is the arousal of
meaning.
Any sensory situation may become an object of perception.
The term perceiving is closely related in most people's
thought with seeing; but objects may be perceived through
any sense or through various combinations of senses. Listen-
ing to a conversation, smelling a meal in preparation, tasting
food, testing the temperature of the bath, as well as looking
at a picture or reading a book, are perceptual activities. The
identification of some food in the mouth through the com-
bined use of taste, smell, contact, and temperature is an act
of perception, also. Sight, hearing, and tactual sensations
may combine in other perceptual activities. Perception is not
limited to objects of the external world; for we may perceive
our own movements, a feeling of hunger, or a toothache.
Kinesthesis and organic sensations, as well as sight and
hearing, may form the basis of perceptions; and so, in fact,
may any sense modality.
A perceptual object usually involves an organized group
of sense data. This organized group of sense data is usually
sensed through a number of sense modalities. Perceiving a
play in a football game often involves not only visual sensa-
tions but also hearing and kinesthetic sensations, as one
sways in sympathy with the ball carrier. The perceptual
significance of motion pictures was greatly enhanced when
sound was added to the sight of the pictures on the screen.
The organized character of the sense data is a product
of previous experience. A foreign language is a mere jumble
of sounds when first heard; but, as these sounds become
associated with the individual's experience, as he learns the
language, the character of the sounds becomes altered in the
237


## p. 238 (#254) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
experience of the learner until they are heard not as a jumble
of sounds, but in an organized fashion, as sounds with a
meaning. When we have learned to read, we have acquired
the habit of perceiving the marks on a printed page as being
organized into units of words and sentences having meaning.
The object may remain constant, but it is perceived in
different ways, depending on the previous experience of the
individual. A young child may perceive an object as a ball,
something to manipulate and to play with, while an adult
will perceive the same object as an orange, something to eat.
The diverse perceptions of the same objective fact are
due to the observer's attitude toward it and also to his
previous experience. The process of perceiving is fundamen-
tally the process of ascribing meaning to the sensory data
to which we attend. The meaning given to sensory experi-
ence depends on the past experience of the observer. We
add to what we see or hear or taste our own interpretation.
of the sensory experience. This interpretation depends
directly on our experience with like sensory data in the past.
The perception depends, to a great extent, on the language
response. When we are asked what we see in any particular
situation, our response is in terms of the names of the objects
that we have learned.
When we observe a picture, we do not see the picture
as it is but we actually perceive more than is there; for our
perception of the picture has three dimensions, the third
dimension of depth being added through the acquired
habit of seeing depth when certain features of perspective
are present. This perception of depth in a two-dimensional
picture is an illusion. Most perceptual activities have a
certain amount of illusion in them. In other words, we add
more to the sensory data than is actually there. This is a
characteristic of perception. We see an orange-colored sphere,
but we perceive an orange, an article of food; and we even
anticipate the taste of the orange as our mouth waters.
The ordinary individual is accustomed to perceiving
238


## p. 239 (#255) ############################################

OBSERVATION ATTENTION AND PERCEPTION
things not as they are but as they ought to be, or at least
as he thinks they ought to be or as he has been accustomed
to seeing them. Mistakes in spelling and other typographical
errors may escape even the careful reader, because in reading
he does not actually see every word and letter but only the
general configuration of the words, and he fills in the meaning
from only a small part of the actual print. It is possible to
read a line accurately when only a fraction of each letter is
present. We perceive an object as a table, although we
are able to see only two of the four legs and a portion of
the top.
Each object acquires in the course of the individual's
experience a multitude of associations and, thus, a variety
of potential meanings. Objects do not possess meaning in
themselves but are endowed with meaning by the individual
who perceives them, and the amount and character of the
meaning that an object attains is a function of the indi-
vidual's past experience. The significance of objects is then
a matter of growth and development. The meanings given
to objects by children are different from the meanings given
to the same objects by mature individuals.
We may now summarize some of the main features of
the perceptual activity that we have discussed. (1) Any
sensory situation may be an object of perception. (2) The
perception is determined by the character of the previous
experience of the individual. (3) Information, in addition
to the sensory data, is added in perceiving. Our discussion of
perceiving is still not complete, for there are further features
that determine the nature of the perception.
Although every object may have many possible meanings,
the significance given to the object in perception is dependent
on the varying circumstances in which it is perceived. The
significance of a wild animal in a cage is very different from
that given to the same animal in the open. The perception
is, therefore, dependent on the character of the objective
environment in which it is perceived. Because the environ-
239


## p. 240 (#256) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
ment in which objects are perceived varies greatly from time
to time, the meaning of the objects varies as well.
Another feature determining the character of the percep-
tion is the condition of the individual who is perceiving.
The meaning of a beefsteak varies with the condition of
the digestive tract of the observer. The meaning of an object
varies with the purpose of the moment. A person hanging a
picture may perceive a clothesbrush as an object with which
to pound in a tack, while the same individual would perceive
the same object at another time as an instrument with which
to brush his coat. Finally, an object will have varying mean-
ings, depending on the sensory aspect of the object noticed.
Every object is more or less complex from a sensory point
of view, and it is possible to attend to a number of different
features of the object. Just what particular feature is at-
tended to determines what the character of the perception.
will be.
9. COMMON ERRORS IN PERCEPTION
As we have seen, perception is the process of ascribing
meaning or significance to sense data. We have noted, also,
that the meaning given is dependent on a number of things,
such as the objective environment, the previous experience of
the individual, the condition of the organism, the purpose
and activity of the moment, as well as the particular feature
of the sensory object to which attention is given. It is possi-
ble, therefore, that the same object may be perceived in
different ways by different individuals and by the same
individual at different times. Most perceptions are inaccu-
rate, or at least incomplete. A survey of the kinds and
conditions of illusions or errors of perception may aid in an
understanding of the basic process.
Although nearly every perception has some amount of
error, it is not usually called an illusion unless the error
is large or striking. While inaccuracies and inadequacies
are prevalent in the whole field of perception, we are not

usually aware of them, and in most cases they have no
serious consequences, although there are occasions when
the accuracy of a perception is very important.
Errors in perception, or illusions, may be due to a number
of factors, among which might be mentioned (a) irregular
or unusual conditions in the external world; (b) defects,

attitudes, and expectation or suggestion.

for, as we have learned that it is not a true face but a reflec-
tion of the image of our own features. Mountains are some-
times perceived as being not very far distant, whereas they
are actually about a hundred miles away. This is again an
illusion-one that is due to the atmospheric conditions.
Our sense organs are very useful instruments, but they are
not infallible or always accurate by any means. If a sound
is made directly behind a person whose eyes are blindfolded,
he may perceive the sound as directly in front of himself,
because the perception of the location of sound without the
aid of vision is extremely inaccurate. The visual after-
sensations, already mentioned, are examples of illusions
caused by peculiarities of the sense organs. Two points
about a half inch apart are readily perceived as two when
applied to the hand, but when they are applied to the
middle of the back they are perceived as one. If the right
hand is left in a bowl of hot water and the left hand in a bowl
of cold water for some time, and then both hands are thrust

into a bowl of lukewarm water, that water seems cold to
one hand and warm to the other. These few simple examples
will serve to indicate that perceptions are conditioned by
limitations in the functioning of the sense organs.
Innumerable errors of perception are caused by the di-
rection of the attention to some particular part of the
total situation and the neglecting of other features. The
stage illusions of the magician are mostly in this class. He
cleverly directs the attention of his audience to some part
of what he is doing and away from other things. The com-
mon illusion of motion that nearly everyone has experienced
in a standing train may be taken as another example. If
your car is motionless, while another on the next track
starts in the opposite direction, you may erroneously per-
ceive that your train is moving. The movement of the field
of vision in the opposite direction is only a part of the ade-
quate stimuli for the perception of motion and, in this
example, the person is making use of only one feature of the
situation in his perception.
Anticipation, or expectation, is another powerful influence
in the production of errors of perception. After one has been
reading a rather thrilling mystery story, the shriek of the
wind may easily be perceived as a cry of distress or a white
garment draped over a chair may be perceived as a ghost.
Experiments on suggestion have shown that college students
can easily be led to feel electric shocks when none exist, to
report warmth in an unheated box, to taste different things
in distilled water, to smell odorless liquids, to feel pressure
on the hand when none is applied, to find differences in the
length of lines or in the weight of objects when no such differ-
ences exist. Medical students have been known to have all
the symptoms of a disorder after studying these symptoms
in their textbooks.
Habits of expectation may work in different ways. If a
piece of cork and a piece of lead weighing exactly the same,
but painted to look alike, are given to a child, he will im-

you
If these same objects are given to an adult to test, he will
tell that the smaller is the heavier because, he, like the
child, expected the larger to be the heavier and thus when he
lifted them he put more effort into lifting the larger, and the
extra effort made the cork seem lighter than the lead. Other
examples of the influence of suggestion were given in Chap.
VI.
Perception is far from being accurate. Illusions or mis-
interpretations of sense impressions are very common.
There are certain checks that may be applied to perceptions.
to determine their accuracy. The data from one sense
modality may be verified in some cases by sensations from
other sensory avenues. There is also what might be called
an experimental check, in which the stimuli are varied in
different ways to determine the effect on the perception.
Another check is social. Do other people perceive it in the
same way as we do? Even with all these checks, however,
it is impossible always to be sure whether a perception is
free from illusion. I saw it with my own eyes or heard it
with my own ears cannot always be accepted as a criterion.
of accuracy.
Social perception may be even more inaccurate and
incomplete than the perception of objects. The accurate
perception of the attitudes, feelings, and emotions of others
is very important in social interaction. The individual who
is successful in social situations is the individual who has
learned to perceive accurately the signs of feeling and emo-
tion in others. The person who fails to perceive that he is
being very boring usually fails to make a satisfactory impres-
sion on others. Social perception is similar to any other
perception. There is a body of sensory data, the attention
is given to these data, and the significance of the sensory
data is inferred. The ability to perceive in the expression
and actions of others how they feel about things, what mood

they are in, and so on, grows with experience; in other words,
it is acquired or learned. The young child is usually lacking
in this ability, but it increases as his experience with other
people is widened.
One method of studying social perception is by means of
photographs. A set of photographs depicting various emo-
tions is prepared. These photographs are given to a number
of individuals and they decide what emotion is portrayed.
The ability to perceive correctly the emotion portrayed
increases gradually with age. The average adult is fairly
accurate, but not by any means perfect. Society seems to
have demanded that individuals hide their emotions as
much as possible, so that in actual life the emotional expres-
sion may not be so distinct or exaggerated as in these pre-
pared pictures. Thus the accuracy of perception of emotion.
is further reduced.
Estimates of traits of character and personality are also
notoriously inaccurate. It would be very valuable if psychol-
ogy could succeed in analyzing and classifying the signs by
means of which intelligence, honesty, and other charac-
teristics are perceived, and thus reduce such perception to a
science. So far, this has been impossible. Some people believe
that they can perceive accurately the ability and other per-
sonality characteristics of individuals by means of such
features as the shape of the face; but such systems have not
been of any real value, as they usually fail when put to
actual test.
Hollingworth, in a very interesting experiment, studied
the ability of 12 expert employment or sales managers to
judge human traits and to determine the fitness of 57 candi-
dates for a particular kind of work. Each of the managers
saw the men for 2 hours, as they were being put through a
series of tests. Later, the managers observed each candidate
as he stood up before an audience and announced his name
and other facts about himself. Each of the managers then
interviewed each candidate separately and asked whatever
245


## p. 246 (#262) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
questions he desired. Each manager ranked the candidates
in order of merit; and, when the rankings of the various
judges were compared, it was found that any candidate
might be ranked anywhere from near the best to near the
worst by the different judges. There was no real correspond-
ence of judgment by the various managers. This example is
typical of many other experiments, which have shown that
the perception of ability and personality in others is usually
extremely inaccurate.
It was found that, when photographs of children ranging
all the way from feeble-minded to very bright were given
to a number of individuals to rank in order of intelligence,
the judgments were not any better than they would have
been if the judges had ranked them by looking at the backs of
the photographs. Other examples of character analysis have
been given in Chap. XI.
IO. THE PLACE OF PERCEPTION IN ADJUSTMENT
We have seen that perception is the process of ascribing
meaning or significance to sense data that are attended
to. We have seen also that the meaning or significance given
to any sense data is determined by a number of conditions,
and that perceptions are often inaccurate. Now a word about
the function of perception in adjustment must be added.
Human activity is a series of adjustments to environ-
mental conditions. Each day and each minute brings its own
problems. A problem is a situation in which the individual
finds himself, for which he has no ready-made activity that
is adequate to take care of it. To adjust to certain situations
is
easy, because we have learned what to do under such
conditions. Learning implies that the individual has at some
time or other modified his activity in such a way that he is
able to adjust to this situation. This learning process is going
on continually as long as the individual lives. Learning
implies that there is a problem requiring some adjustment.
Perception forms a link in the chain. For example, the individ-
246


## p. 247 (#263) ############################################

OBSERVATION-ATTENTION AND PERCEPTION
ual finds himself in a novel situation and is forced to make
some adjustment. The form that the adjustment will take is
determined largely by the meaning or significance given to
the situation in the individual's perception of it. Perception
is not an isolated process but is involved in all activity as
well as in the acquisition of knowledge or information.

LEARNING
LE
I. LEARNING DEFINED
EARNING may be defined as the more, or less permanent
modification of an individual's activity in a given situa-
tion, due to practice in attempts to achieve some goal or
solve some problem. The several features of this definition
should become clearer as we proceed with the discussion.
The activity of the individual is changed or modified in two
ways: by maturation, or growth, and by learning.
From the beginning of the individual's life he is continually
undergoing development or change. Besides the process of
natural growth, or maturation, there is also the process of
modification due to experience. While maturation is pretty.
much a process of development with which the individual
himself has little to do, learning is very much an active
process and depends on the activity of the individual
himself.
Living is adjusting; and adjusting is a process of modify-
ing one's activity to fit the varying circumstances of
life. Learning is perhaps the most important topic in
psychology.
The complex behavior of the adult is the result of the
gradual but continual modification of the activity of the
individual from birth till death. The primitive responses of
the infant soon become inadequate to meet the complex
situations of human relationships and activities and have
to be modified. As we have seen, the child has a number of
needs or appetites that demand a satisfactory adjustment,
and so the child has to learn to satisfy these appetites in a
way that is not only adequate but also socially acceptable.

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
2. LEARNING IN PHYLOGENETIC AND
ONTOGENETIC DEVELOPMENT
One indication of the importance of the process of learning
is to trace the place of learning throughout the animal scale
and also in the development of the human individual. All
animals can and do learn, but not all animals learn an equal
amount or equally fast. In the animal kingdom there is a
progressive increase in the amount and complexity of learn-
ing with an increase in the complexity of the nervous system.
Learning is the basis of the process of adapting to the chang-
ing conditions of life.
The human being has the greatest power of adaptability
and, therefore, the greatest learning ability. As we have
noted before, the human infant comes into the world with
very few adequate forms of behavior but with an enormous
capacity for learning or modifying this behavior to adapt to
the varied conditions of living. During the first few years of
the life of the infant he learns many useful things, he acquires
muscular coordinations of various kinds, he learns to manip-
ulate objects and also people, he is acquiring the meanings
of objects and events. During the preschool years the child
learns to walk, to talk, to control physiological habits, to eat,
to dress, to fear certain things, and so on through an almost
endless list of activities.
With the beginning of school life, the child is started
on the long trail of acquiring information that has been
accumulated by his forebears through long centuries, or
at least that part of this information that a wise school
system decrees is necessary. Along with this formal learning
there goes a wide variety of other learnings, social behavior,
the ethics of the street and the school yard, the control of
emotions, nonacademic skills involved in play and athletics,
and the likes and dislikes that are related to all these ac-
tivities. As the child increases in age, the field of his learning
increases in scope, and he begins the acquisition of the skills
250


## p. 251 (#267) ############################################

LEARNING
that are to be useful later in earning a living. Even when
the child has developed into an adult, the learning does
not stop, for he is continually acquiring new information,
learning new activities, forming new opinions, beliefs, and
ideas. So learning goes on from birth till death, and to stop
learning is to stop living. We cannot help learning, but we
can control what we learn and how we learn. This extremely
incomplete picture of development will perhaps serve to
emphasize the importance of the process of learning. Many
associate the term learning with the formal education process,
but learning means much more than schooling.
Another way of indicating the importance of this topic of
learning and, at the same time, showing how all the topics
of psychology are bound up together, is to glance briefly
through the topics already discussed and see what part
learning plays in them all. In our discussion of attention
we noted a development of the different kinds of attention-
involuntary, voluntary, and spontaneous. This development
took place through learning. Perception, we found, was the
process of acquiring meanings for sensory impressions.
Thinking and imagination involve learning. Feelings, likes
and dislikes, attitudes are all acquired. Emotions of fear
and anger are modified during development by learning.
Motivation showed a progressive change in the kinds of
effective motives due to learning. So, throughout all the
topics discussed, there has been a background of learning.
Now we are to study this learning process in detail.
3. KINDS OF LEARNING
There are a number of different kinds of learning, which,
of course, may be expressions of one basic process. Activities
may be organized into new patterns of behavior; for example,
in learning to typewrite, the activities of sitting upright, of
manipulating the fingers, and so on, are organized into a
new pattern of activity, that of striking the keys in a sys-
tematic way in order to achieve a desired result. Activities
251

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
may be isolated from larger behavior units and used for
definite purposes aside from the larger behavior pattern
to which they originally belonged. Activities may be selected
from a wide range of varied behavior. This kind of learning is
often called trial-and-error-learning.
The detachment of a response from a stimulus, usually
called negative adaptation, is another kind of learning, in
which we learn not to respond to a constantly recurring
but harmless and perhaps meaningless stimulus. Again,
a response may be attached to a stimulus with which it
originally had no connection. This method of learning is
usually called the conditioned-response method. It may be
illustrated by one of the famous experiments of the Russian
physiologist Pavlov, in which the response-flow of saliva—
was connected through repetition with a new stimulus, the
ringing of a bell. Another form of learning is seen in memoriz-
ing, where the stimulus for the activity is gradually reduced
until finally the individual is able to repeat a poem, for
instance, without the stimulus of the printed page, merely
requiring the title of the poem to start and sustain the
activity. These are some of the main kinds of learning. They
are probably all similar in some fundamental respects, and
may be considered as varieties of the one process of learning.
4. VERBAL LEARNING, OR MEMORIZATION
Remembering is the direct use of what has been learned;
it is performing a ready-made activity that was acquired
in the past. There are a number of features concerned with
the process of remembering that require attention. First,
there is the process of memorizing, then there are two ways
of indicating that the individual remembers-by recall
and recognition; and finally there is the fact of retention.
We will deal with these various features in turn. Memory,
or remembering, is one of the parts of psychology in which
experiments have been very fruitful in indicating what
252


## p. 253 (#269) ############################################

LEARNING
conditions are favorable or unfavorable in producing effi-
ciency of performance.
Memorizing is the process of experiencing or coming to
know something in such a way as to be able to recall it
at a later time, or at least to recognize that it has been ex-
perienced before. Memorizing can be illustrated best in
terms of verbal material. Insight into the fundamental
process may be acquired if we analyze the process into its
simple features. The first feature to be considered is the
immediate memory span. A short series of words or syllables
or digits can be reproduced accurately without error after
the series has once been seen or heard. However, if the
series is much longer, this is impossible. By means of a simple
experiment the length of a series that can be immediately
reproduced after one impression can be determined. This
is what is called the immediate memory span. Take the
following series of letters, and, covering them with a piece
of paper, slide the paper along until you can see just the
first line; read it once; try to reproduce it without looking
at the book; then test your reproduction. Go on to the next
line and so on through the list.

When you have tried this experiment you will know that
there is a limit to the amount of material that can be
retained after one reading. When more material than the
immediate memory span is attempted, it is found that the in-
dividual is unable to reproduce even so much as the memory
253


## p. 254 (#270) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
span. In the example above, if you discovered that your im-
mediate memory span was seven letters, when you attempted
a longer series you were unable to reproduce seven, but were
probably able to reproduce only three or four. This inability
or inhibition is present whenever the individual attempts to
remember more than the immediate memory span. However,
it is possible, by repetition to memorize even very long
material. Repetition is the method utilized to overcome the
inhibition that occurs when the material is too long to grasp
in one impression. The function of repetition is to enable the
individual to increase the meaningfulness of the material,
or to relate the different parts of the material together.
This process of overcoming the inhibition requires further
study. Another simple experiment may illustrate a funda-
mental feature of the process of memorization. Starting
with list I, read the list, then test to see how much you can
recall, either by writing or by having someone check your
recall with the book. Continue in this way until you are able
to recall the total list without error. Go on to list 2 and follow
the same procedure; then do the same with lists 3 and 4.
Keep count each time of the number of repetitions of the
list that were necessary in order to learn it.

The main difference between these series of words is in
meaningfullness. List 1 is almost meaningless; list 2 gives
words that are real words with a real meaning, but there is

LEARNING
contains
no obvious connection between them; while list 3
words that are all names of fruits, and list 4 forms a sentence
with meaning. Your results in memorizing the above lists
probably have showed that the more meaning there is in
the material the more easily and quickly is that material
learned. The function of repetition in memorization is to
discover meaning in the material or, if no meaning exists,
to manufacture some. The process of memorization is,
therefore, an active process; and the more observant the
learner is in seeking and discovering meaning and relation-
ships within the material being learned, the more efficient
he is in the task.
The perception of any object or event is not a guarantee
that it will be remembered. Most people look at their
watches dozens of times every day; yet, if you ask a large
number of people to tell you whether the numerals on their
watches are Roman or Arabic, most of them will be unable
to do so. They have made no effort to learn or memorize
that piece of information and, consequently, there has been
no retention. This is another fundamental fact about
remembering: it is not a passive sponging up of information
but an active seeking, discovering process, in which the
intention to remember is present.
Retention is not an activity but rather a resting state.
Memorization produces some effects, presumably on the
nervous system, so that, when at a later date the individual
is called upon to make use of the material memorized, he
recalls it. What goes on in between memorization and
recall is not known. However, a few facts may give us a little
idea as to what retention is.
The effects produced by memorization seem gradually
to fade away, if the original experience is not recalled or
used. The secret of permanent retention of any material is
frequent use of that material. The curve of forgetting, or
the graphical representation of the amount of information.
retained in the memory for various lengths of time, indicates
255


## p. 256 (#272) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
that usually a great deal is forgotten immediately after
learning and then the forgetting slows down. Material that
is overlearned is forgotten more slowly than material which
is barely learned. Meaningful material is also retained better
than is meaningless material.
Retention may be aided by constant review or use. Mate-
rials may be remembered for long periods if they are reviewed
from time to time. The reverse is true for those experiences
that we wish to forget. They can be forgotten by avoiding all
reference to them, by avoiding all scenes and circumstances
that are likely to suggest them. Some people try to suppress
unpleasant experiences, but the process of suppression, as we
have seen in another connection, is a rather dangerous
procedure.
The characteristics of recall and recognition may be
studied best by a survey of the difficulties in these functions.
Recall is the process of reviving an experience, while recogni-
tion is the process of knowing that you have had the experi-
ence before. One reason why we are unable to recall material
or experiences is that we have failed in the actual learning or
memorization. Even when material has been well learned,
there are some occasions when it cannot be recalled. We know
a person's name, for instance, but we are unable to recall it.
We may know the answer to an examination question, but
at the actual examination we give the wrong answer, and
only later on the way home we recall what we should have
written. There has been some kind of interference blocking
the recall.
One very common type of interference is emotional
experience. Stage fright has marred many a well-prepared
speech. Fear, anger, or self-consciousness will often form
a barrier to efficient recall. This kind of interference can be
removed if the person will become so interested and absorbed
in his subject as to forget himself. Self-consciousness is caused
by the individual's attending to himself and worrying about
what other people are thinking. If the individual can attend
256


## p. 257 (#273) ############################################

LEARNING
to the actual material he is recalling and not to himself, this
fear or self-consciousness is not present to block recall.
Another kind of interference occurs when one recall blocks
another. You try to recall a person's name, but another
name is aroused and this name blocks the recall of the name
that is wanted. In solving a difficult problem, such as a
problem in mathematics, an incorrect solution keeps recur-
ring, thus preventing the recall of any other solution. A
course that is usually effective in such a situation is to drop
the activity entirely for a time and come back to it later.
Further light is obtained on the process of recall when
retention is imperfect and there is only partial recall. In such
situations, the interesting thing is that the individual usually
fills in the blanks and makes a rounded-out picture. In the
recall of imperfectly learned drawings, the reproductions
from memory resemble the originals in some particulars
but in every case the reproduction is complete in itself. The
same is true of partially recalled names only a part of the
name is correctly recalled but the rest is filled in with other
syllables. In the recall of events and experiences, this same
process can be noted. Certain facts are remembered, other
facts are forgotten; but the recall of the experience is filled
out to make a complete, logical account, so that when it is
checked against what actually did happen there are many
inaccuracies and errors. Most recall is imperfect in some
respect. Some facts are eliminated, others are emphasized,
and the whole is made into a rounded-out, complete account.
There is always a stimulus for recall. This stimulus is not
so complete as it was in the original experience. You memo-
rized "The Charge of the Light Brigade," and now the title
of the poem may be a sufficient stimulus to start you to
reciting the poem. The stimulus in the learning situation
was the printed poem. The process of remembering is, then,
the performance now with a reduced stimulus of some
activity that was originally performed with a much more
complete stimulating situation. The essential feature in
257


## p. 258 (#274) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
memorization is the reduction of the stimulus necessary to
call forth a complex response, and recall is the arousing of
an activity by means of a reduced stimulus.
Recognition is easier than recall. If you were to read over
a list of 50 names, you would probably be able to recall only
a few of the list; but if, after reading over the 50 names, you
were to read another list among which were the first 50
names, you would probably be able to recognize or pick out
of that list a number of the original list. It may be very
difficult to sit down and write out a list of the persons who
were your classmates at school; but, if you read a list of
alumni of the old school, you would probably be able to recog-
nize most of the names of your classmates in the larger list.
Just as is the case in recall, so recognition is not by any
means always perfect. There are errors in the process of
recognition. Almost everyone has at some time or other
spoken to someone whom he thought that he knew, only to
discover that the other was a total stranger. Recognition
makes use of reduced stimuli, just as recall does. In the case of
wrong identification, there were some features of the stranger
that were similar to those of the friend, and the reaction
to a part of the total situation caused the false recognition.
In order to make sure of later recognition of an object
or a person, it is best to make some definite response to the
object or individual. To be able to recognize an object at a
later date, it is necessary to have noted something about it,
such as how it differs from other objects. Casual observation
of faces is not usually enough to ensure their later recogni-
tion. Experiments with students have shown that recognition
is often very imperfect, unless there is an actual attention
to the individual and a conscious noting of features that
distinguish one individual from another.
5. AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROCESS OF LEARNING
Thus far in our account of learning, we have succeeded in
making the topic very complicated, so it is time to introduce
258


## p. 259 (#275) ############################################

LEARNING
some simplification. Often much is learned about a mecha-
nism or a process by taking it apart, so we will try to take
apart this process of learning and look at the separate
features of it. In order to do this, let us look at a very simple
example of learning. Suppose that a very intelligent dog has
been locked in the woodshed without food for 24 hours.
There is a large yard enclosed by a high fence, and in one
corner of the yard there is a gate with a thumb latch. When
the hungry dog is let out into the yard, a plate of very desir-
able food is placed outside the gate within sight and smell
of the dog. He goes through a wide variety of behavior,
running around the yard, trying to jump over the fence,
digging under the fence, barking and whining. He spends
most of his time in the corner of the yard where the gate is.
Finally, after about an hour, in one of his jumps at the
gate, the dog's paw comes in contact with the thumb latch,
the gate opens, and the dog gets the food. Has he learned to
let himself out of the yard? If so, how did he learn? These
questions can be answered only by further trials. Again the
dog is locked up away from food, and again he is let out into
the yard. He has not learned, after all; for he goes through
much the same procedure as before, running, jumping, bark-
ing, scratching. However, eventually he does get out again.
Can the dog ever learn to let himself out of the yard imme-
diately after he is put in? This can be found out by continu-
ing the tests. After being tested day after day, finally, in a
few weeks, the dog learns to go immediately to the gate,
paw the latch, and thus open the gate.
Let us retrace our steps and find out what we can learn
from this dog experiment. One very important thing that
we took for granted we must have learned from previous
experience with dogs. This is that it is necessary to have the
dog hungry if we expect him to try to get out to reach the
food. This fact we will call the first point in our analysis—
the necessity for motivation. This point cannot be stressed too
much. There must be a reason for all activity. The learner
259

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
must have some form of motivation. No motivation, no
learning!
Let us look for some other features of this process. We
were careful in the dog experiment to arrange things so that
he could not get at the food immediately, and yet in such a
way that he could reach it after a time. In other words, we
arranged a problem for a dog. If there had been no problem,
there would have been nothing for the dog to learn, no
necessity for learning. If we had padlocked the gate and put
the key in the yard for the dog to find and use to unlock the
gate, either the dog would have starved to death or the
experiment would have been called off. To put this in other
words, before there is learning, there has to be a problem;
and the problem must be a possible one for the learner.
Besides, the learner must recognize that there is a problem.
So, the second important feature of the learning process we
have found is the presence of a problem that is possible of
solution and that is recognized by the learner.
In order to have learning, the problem must be more than
recognized; it must be attacked. The dog attacked his
problem vigorously. He tried every kind of behavior that
he had found to be of use in other situations. His attack on
the problem was diverse, with recourse to many different
efforts. If he had tried only one kind of activity, such as
running around the yard looking for holes in the fence, he
would have died of exhaustion without succeeding. The more
varied and extensive the past experience of the individual,
the more likely is he to try out different lines of attack. The
more intelligent the individual is, the less is the attack overt
and the more does it conform to reasoning and not to trial-
and-error behavior.
A human subject in such a problematic situation would
probably sit down and figure out the situation in some such
terms as these: "Let's see, if I tried that way, it wouldn't
work; and if I tried this, it probably wouldn't work either;
but here, let's see how this would work. No, that wouldn't
260


## p. 261 (#277) ############################################

LEARNING
work either." So he would go on until he discovered in his
reasoning a way out, and then he would proceed directly
and immediately to the solution. However, whether the
attack is overt or in thought, there must be an active attack
on the problem before a solution is discovered and learning
takes place. This is the third feature in the learning process.
Another important feature of learning is illustrated in
the dog experiment. The dog was persistent until he achieved
success. Persistence is the fourth essential to learning.
Persistence is a function that consists of a number of ele-
ments. For instance, the past history of successes and failures
conditions the persistence in learning situations. If the
individual has been unsuccessful in most situations, he
expects failure and thus does not persist for any length of
time. When the individual has learned to expect success
because he has been successful in most situations, he will
persist until he has found a solution. Success produces cor-
fidence and confidence in oneself is productive of persistence.
The child accustomed to failure soon gives up. Persistence
is a function of the motivation. If the result is worth the
effort, the individual persists until he is successful.
We also found that in the case of the dog repetition was
necessary for learning. What happens during repetition is
that the correct solution is selected from the variety of
possible activities, and is fixated. The useless or nonade-
quate forms of activity drop out as they are proved useless.
In human learning there are times when the learner discovers
and fixates the solution in one attempt and repetition seems
unnecessary, but such occasions are very infrequent. Even
on those occasions when the solution is discovered quickly,
it is usually necessary to repeat the whole situation and the
activity in order to fixate it, so that it will be remembered
later.
If we look at any other examples of learning, such as that
of a white rat learning to run a maze, an ape learning a
complicated problem, a child learning to talk, a bride learning

LEARNING
to bake a cake, or in fact any learning activity, the same
features will be found. Let us emphasize these features by
repetition.
1. The learner must be motivated.
2. There must be a recognized and possible problem.
3. The problem must be attacked with diverse activities.
4. The learner must persist until he is successful.
5. Repetition of the whole learning situation is neces-
sary for selection and fixation.
6. THE MEASUREMENT OF LEARNING
Other important features of the learning process will
come to light if we attempt to measure the process itself.
In order to measure learning, it is necessary to take some
very definite sample of learning that lends itself to expression
in numerical quantities. Then we must control and restrict
the conditions of the learning. Finally, in order to measure,
we must have a measuring stick of some kind. So we arrange
a learning situation; arbitrarily decide on some unit, such
as a trial or a unit of time, and also a definite measure of
achievement, such as speed or accuracy; and record the
progress of our subjects in the form of a graph.
Perhaps this can be made more understandable by means
of an actual example. Let us suppose that we are going to
measure the progress of a subject who is learning to type-
write. We arrange that this subject shall practice type-
writing for half an hour at the same time each day, and at
the end of the half-hour period we have him copy on the
typewriter 500 words. We time him as he does so, and count
the errors made in this selection each day. The unit of ac-
tivity used for the graph will be the daily trial, and the
measure of achievement will be either the time taken to
type the 500 words or the number of errors made. Let us
suppose that this is continued for 50 days. We can then con-
struct a learning curve to picture the progress made by the
subject in his learning.
263


## p. 264 (#280) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
Not all learning curves are the same shape, by any means;
but there are certain characteristic features that are com-
mon to the majority of such curves, and an outline of these
features should further increase our knowledge of the learning
process.
a. Most learning curves show an initial rapid rise. Progress
is swift on the first few trials. Such a period of rapid progress
at the beginning of learning may be due to a combination of
various factors. Rarely, if ever, is a learning task started
at zero. Rather, we make use of previously learned activities
and build on them. In the typing example, the typist had
already learned to sit erect in a chair, to manipulate his
fingers, to coordinate the movements of his fingers with his
visual perceptions, to spell, to form sentences, and so on.
In the acquiring of this new activity, these old habits are
used and are either combined in new patterns or are the
foundation on which further activities are built. This initial
spurt in learning may be due to the use of these old habits.
Another possible factor is that human beings almost always
seem to do the easier parts of a task first. The learner,
then, may be acquiring the easier parts of the activity before
going on to the more difficult; or, again, it is possible that
the zeal and enthusiasm for a new task cause him to throw
into the task more than his usual amount of
energy.
b. Another characteristic of the majority of learning
curves is negative acceleration. By this we mean that the rate
of improvement gradually slows down, so that, for instance,
the learner makes much more progress between the fifth
and tenth trials than he does between the thirty-fifth and
fortieth trials. In a complex activity, the easier acts are
usually acquired first, and therefore learning gradually
slows down in terms of amount of progress in a given unit
of time. There are exceptions to this rule, as, for example,
in the learning of a foreign language, where the number of
new words acquired per unit of time may increase as the
words learned make it easier to acquire still other words.
264

LEARNING
However, the learning curve of any skill, such as typ-
ing, telegraphy, skating, and so on, is usually negatively
accelerated.
c. All individual learning curves show many irregularities,
indicating varying performance from trial to trial. Progress
is not by any means smooth or regular. These irregularities

Like most complex learning curves, the one showing progress in learning
to typewrite indicates a rapid initial rise; a plateau, or period of no prog-
ress; and the psychological limit of improvement, or the limit of improve-
ment possible under present conditions.
may be due to a number of different features, some of which
may be mentioned here. Subjective conditions may produce
irregularities. Such conditions are differences in motivation,
in incentives, in interests, in mood, in attitude, or in any
other kind of difference within the individual from trial to
trial. Physiological conditions, fatigue, health, lack of sleep,
use of drugs, and so on, may be effective also in causing varia-
bility of performance from trial to trial. Objective conditions,
such as temperature and illumination, may have their
effect also. If all these conditions could be rigidly controlled
265


## p. 266 (#282) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
from trial to trial, the learning curve would probably be
smooth and show none of these irregularities. However, this
is impossible, and so all learning curves have irregularities.
d. Some learning curves, especially those for complex
problems, have what are known as plateaus. A plateau in
the learning curve represents a period in the learning when
there is no measurable progress. Plateaus, although they
are not inevitable, are to be expected. A plateau may repre-
sent the level of achievement possible with the present
method of attack on the problem, and with better methods
the plateau may be left behind. A plateau may indicate
that the learner is preparing to make a shift from one stage
in the learning process to another stage. In learning to send
messages by telegraph, the learner usually reaches a point
where further progress is impossible unless he learns to send
by larger units. He may have been sending in letter units
and, in order to achieve more speed, he needs to learn to
send the messages in word units. Another cause of plateaus
in learning curves is the use of habits that are ill-adapted to
the function being learned. In order to make further progress,
the individual has to acquire other habits that are better
suited to the situation. Plateaus may be caused by fatigue,
eye trouble, or other physiological conditions. Plateaus
may appear in the learning curve and persist for some time,
even when actual progress is being made, but when the
progress is not the kind that is being measured by the
units of measurement which have been selected. Plateaus
may be left behind by increased effort due to increased
incentive, by mere persistence, or by the adoption of a better
method of attack on the problem. Workers may go on for a
long time at a certain level of efficiency, but the introduction
of some additional reward may produce a considerable
improvement, resulting from the increased effort caused by
the increased motivation.
e. There are two kinds of limits that may be seen in learn-
ing curves. The first kind we will call the physiological limit

such as playing the piano, throwing a baseball, and surgery,
such a limit is never reached, even after a lifetime of practice;
there is always room for further improvement. In acquiring
information there is no physiological limit. In the ordinary
activities of everyday life, such as writing, reading, shaving,
opening envelopes, sorting cards, memorizing, and studying,
most people are functioning at a speed and efficiency far below
their possible maximum. Learning in such activities is
negatively accelerated, so that after the attainment of a
certain level of efficiency any further improvement requires
a great amount of effort-much more, in fact, than was
required earlier in the learning situation. What we usually
do is to improve until we have acquired a level of efficiency
that is sufficient to get along with. It requires a strong
incentive to push people beyond this level.
267


## p. 268 (#284) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
The second limit we will call the psychological limit of
improvement. This is the limit of improvement possible with
the present conditions of motivation, interest, methods, and
other features. It is not by any means the absolute limit
that is possible; because, if any of these conditions is radically
changed the individual may improve further. So, the psy-
chological limit is really a plateau, because further improve-
ment is possible.
From this study of learning curves, we have seen that
learning does not start at zero; that improvement is usually
rapid at first and then slows down; that there may be periods
of no improvement followed by further progress; and that,
although there is an absolute limit of improvement in motor
skills, this limit is hardly ever reached. The use of the learn-
ing curve to gauge the rate of progress in learning is recom-
mended, because it is a means of arousing and sustaining
interest and also a method of measuring progress.
7. FACTORS AFFECTING THE EFFICIENCY OF LEARNING
During the last few years many experiments have been
conducted to discover what conditions affect the progress of
learning. Much has been found out, but still more awaits
further research. In the following paragraphs we will attempt
to summarize the factors that have an influence on the speed
of learning. These factors will be classified as subjective
(having to do with the condition of the learner), related to
the material, or depending on methods.
a. Subjective factors.
1. Individual differences. People differ greatly in the
ability to learn. If all other factors were constant, we should
still find that in any group of individuals the best learner
would be several times better than the poorest learner. This
great individual variation in learning ability we accept at the
present time as being due to inborn differences in capacity,
268


## p. 269 (#285) ############################################

LEARNING
although in the future it is possible that other reasons will
be discovered to explain this fact of individual variation.
2. Age. It was thought at one time that children could
learn much more quickly than adults, but we know now that
this is not true. Learning ability increases with age up to
maturity. The adult can learn more rapidly than the child if
he can get rid of the old idea that you can't teach an old dog
new tricks. An old dog or a middle-aged man can be taught
new tricks quite easily if you can manage to motivate him.
The trouble with most middle-aged men or women is not
that they are too old to learn, but that they lack the neces-
´sary self-confidence as far as learning is concerned, or that
they are so complacent that they do not see the need of
trying to learn more. The child is characteristically enthu-
siastic and interested, while the adult is characteristically in
a rut. The adult fears social disapproval, because setting out
to learn implies that there is something that he does not
know, which, of course, is usually a painful admission to
make. Or he may be afraid of losing some of his dignity,
because we have thought for ages that childhood is the time
for learning, and that, if the adult embarks on a voyage of
discovery, he is becoming a child again. But age is a very
minor factor in anything depending on learning. If he will,
the adult can learn just as rapidly as the child.
3. Attitude of the subject. Learning is essentially an active
process. As William James said, long ago, "We learn by
doing." Learning is aided by active participation. We may
learn something by watching others, but trying the activity
for ourselves is necessary for rapid and permanent learning.
We are helped by observing the professional hit the golf
ball, but we can never learn to play golf until we actually
take a club in our hands and try to hit the elusive ball for
ourselves.
Many thousands of hours are wasted in the schoolroom
because the child's interest is not aroused and his active
participation secured. It is possible to get the child to learn
269


## p. 270 (#286) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
facts in geography in which he has no interest by holding out
rewards or by threatening punishment; but it is infinitely
easier for both the child and the teacher if he is learning
something in which he is really interested.
Interest in a subject causes the learner to throw more
effort into the task, narrows down his attention, and makes
distractions less potent. The speed of learning is directly
related to the amount of interest that the learner has in the
task.
The intention to learn is essential for efficient learning.
To observe a fact is not enough. In order to be remembered,
the fact must be observed with intention to remember. If
you ask a number of individuals to notice a number of words,
to see whether they can spell them, and then later ask them
to recall as many of the words as possible, the recall would
not be nearly so complete as it would be if you had asked the
subjects to attempt to remember the words. In the first case,
the learning attitude was not present; while in the second,
the subjects would have the intention of learning. Pairs of
words were given to a group of individuals to learn, and,
after a certain number of repetitions, about 75 per cent could
give the second of the pair when the first was mentioned; but
only about 7 per cent could give the first of the pair when the
second was used as the stimulus. They had learned them in
that way; they intended to remember the second of the pair
when the first was given but had not the intention of remem-
bering the first when the second was given. The purpose for
which anything is learned conditions the remembering or
forgetting. When a student learns certain material for a
particular purpose, such as an examination at a certain date,
forgetting occurs very rapidly after that date. The will to
learn is very important. It is the intense effort that educates.
We do not remember a person's name, often because we do
not make a definite effort to do so. The attentive attitude is
necessary for efficient learning. The degree and direction of
attention has a great deal to do with the efficiency of the
270


## p. 271 (#287) ############################################

LEARNING
learning and remembering. Emotional attitudes also have
their effects on learning. Moods, feelings of depression or
well-being aid or hinder learning, depending on their quality.
Throughout all the details mentioned in this section extends
the one basic fact that efficient learning depends on an alert,
active attitude directed intelligently to the task at hand.
4. Physiological conditions. Efficient learning is de-
pendent on a healthy physical and mental condition, as
learning is hindered greatly by fatigue and ill-health. The
student who burns the midnight oil could cover the same
material much more efficiently in about half the time, the
next morning, after a good night's rest.
5. Sex. There seems to be little difference in learning
ability between boys and girls. Girls are supposed to be more
efficient in language or verbal learning, while boys usually
excel in mechanical activities. This difference may not be
a native difference, but rather a difference due to the different
interests imposed on the different sexes by society.
6. Intelligence. There is a close relationship between
learning and intelligence. The more intelligent individual
usually learns more quickly than the less intelligent. Learning
depends to a considerable extent on the ability to perceive
the necessary relationships between the parts of the activity;
in other words, understanding material is the first step in
learning it. The more meaning we can get into the material
or activity, the easier it is to learn and remember it. In-
telligence is just this ability to find meaning in situations, to
understand; so that it is to be expected that the more intelli-
gent individual should be a more efficient learner than the
less intelligent. However, as we saw earlier in our discussion,
one of the essential features in learning is persistence. If an
individual is persistent enough, he can learn anything, even
though he may not be endowed with a very high degree of
intelligence. The main difference between the individual of
high intelligence and the person with less intelligence is the
length of time that each requires to learn things. A few years
271

ago, it was thought useless to try to teach the feeble-minded
anything, but today the children in a hospital for feeble-
minded go to school and learn a great deal. True, it may take
them longer to learn things than it does other children; but,
with sufficient motivation to keep them persisting, they can
and do make great progress.
7. Previous practice or transfer of training. Does the
learning of one kind of fact aid in the learning of others; or,
in other words, is there a transfer of training? This age-old
question was first formulated to apply to the educational
system as follows: Does the study of a subject such as Latin
help the individual to learn other things? That is, is there
any value in the formal discipline of study? Of course, there
is no definite proved answer to this general question, but
there are indications that the learning of one set of facts
aids the learning of others only in so far as methods perfected
in one situation are carried over to others and made to apply
there. Memory systems that attempt to improve the memory
by exercises in learning lists of numbers and syllables are
just so much waste time, because there is no "faculty" of
memory that can be improved by practice. Rather, there
are a number of kinds of memory. If the individual would
improve his memory for names, for instance, the thing to do
is not to practice with lists of numbers or anything else, but
to practice remembering names. However, previous practice
or established habits, when they can be incorporated into
the new activity, are a distinct aid to learning. As has been
said previously, no learning process ever starts at zero. Each
builds on the foundation of previous learning; but, in order
to be used in learning, previous practice must have a real
bearing on the present activity.
8. Life bents and dispositions. An individual's learning
of any particular subject is often conditioned by habits, life
bents, or dispositions formed at some previous time. It is
possible to build up almost permanent likes and dislikes for
subjects. An unsympathetic teacher may easily cause a child
272


## p. 273 (#289) ############################################

LEARNING.
to dislike such a subject as spelling, so that the learning-to-
spell activity is hindered by this dislike to such an extent
that the child may have real difficulty in learning to spell,
although his ability to do so may be quite normal. Girls are
often told that they cannot be expected to be able to do
mathematics as well as boys, and this opinion or idea may
become fixed, and thus act as a life bent that handicaps their
learning of mathematics. One failure in some subject, which
may have been due, not to lack of ability but to some other
cause, may be sufficient to build up an idea in the mind of
the individual that he cannot learn that particular subject,
and this disposition produces an attitude that is detrimental
to any success in that line of endeavor.
b. Characteristics of the material or activity.
Some kinds of material are more easily learned than
other types, and also some skills are acquired with greater
facility than others. Material endowed with a high degree
of meaningfulness is much more easily learned than less
meaningful material. If the material is not in itself meaning-
ful, the learner must endow it with meaning in order to
remember it. The same principle applies to motor activities.
A new swing in golf is more easily acquired if the reason
for the particular movements required is understood by the
learner. Blind learning, or learning without understanding,
is always inefficient. This is the old distinction between rote
and logical learning; and in all experiments bearing on this
problem rote learning always comes off second best.
c. Methods of learning.
Just as the mental attitude and the physical and environ-
mental conditions of the individual, as well as the kind of
material, play an important part in the speed of learning,
so the efficiency of learning is either hindered or assisted by
the methods used in the learning situation.
1. Distribution of practice. When we have a long selection
273


## p. 274 (#290) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
to memorize or a complex skill to acquire, is it more efficient
to attempt to do so at one sitting or should the time to be
spent on it be divided up into smaller units separated by
periods of time? Research on this question has indicated
that it is much more economical of effort, besides producing
much more permanent retention, if the time spent on learning
is divided into units and distributed over a period. Short,
intensive learning periods, with intervals of time between
them, produce more learning than will the same amount of
time massed together.
2. Length of practice periods. If time spent on learning
should be distributed, the question arises as to what is the
best length of time to engage in learning without a break.
The answer to this depends on the kind of learning problem
involved; but, in general, short periods are more economical
than long periods. It was found that more material was
remembered when it was learned in half-hour periods than
in 15-minute periods or 45-minute periods or hour periods.
The general principle seems to be to allow enough time so
that the benefit of warming up or getting into the swing
of the thing is not lost, but not long enough so that fatigue
and boredom become effective.
3. Whole or part? Whenever possible, the learning of a
skill or the memorization of a selection should be as a whole
rather than in parts. The main reason why whole learning is
more effective than part learning is that the factor of meaning
is more operative in whole learning than in part learning.
4. Review. The secret of retention of memories or skills
is review. Much is forgotten, but the process of forgetting
can be halted or, at least, retarded by carefully spaced
reviews. This is true of both verbal and motor learning. Use
or review keeps memories fresh and skills efficient.
5. Guidance or tuition. Nothing is ever taught; it must
be learned. Although this is true, it does not mean that
teaching or tuition is fruitless. Teaching has its place; but
teaching, if it is to be of value, is guidance. However, there
274


## p. 275 (#291) ############################################

LEARNING
must not be too much guidance. We learn by doing. Research
on the value of guidance in learning has shown that guidance
may not only be useless but actually detrimental to learning
if it is too plentiful or if it is introduced too late in the learn-
ing process. Information regarding the success or failure of
the learner, if he understands that information, is of value;
but such information is most effective if it is given near the
beginning of learning. We learn by making mistakes, and a
certain amount of error seems to be necessary in learning.
In order that there may be learning, errors must be com-
prehended as such. Assistance in the discovery of errors,
in the diagnosis of difficulties, and in the redirection of the
learner is an aid to learning. One of the best methods of
directing the learning of others is through their interests.
If we can arrange to get people interested in a task or a
subject, then the learning requires very little teaching.
8. HABITS IN EVERYDAY LIVING—ACQUIRING AND BREAKING
HABITS
Habits are the foundation and framework of all adult
activity. There are many kinds of habits-habits of acting,
of thinking, and of feeling. Almost all of our daily activity
is composed of habits. A habit is essentially an activity that
has been performed often enough to function easily and
without much conscious effort; in other words, almost
mechanically. Start a habit, and it goes on almost auto-
matically. We don't have to stop and think about it; it is a
laborsaving device. In fact, too much attention and thought
may throw a habit out of gear. Stop to think about how you
tie your shoelaces in the morning, and you will find that
thinking about it hindered the habit rather than aided it.
The automatic nature of habit is illustrated by the humorous
situation in which the author found himself one evening.
Before going out, he wished to change his tie. He started
this activity and went on thinking about other things. When
he "came to," he found that he had undressed himself and
275


## p. 276 (#292) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
was preparing for bed. The old, habitual activity of undress-
ing had been started by the removal of the necktie and went
on further than was desired.
Habits may be good or bad. The great majority of our
habits are useful and carry on the day's routine with very
little attention or effort on our part. Habit frees the attention
for new things. Think how laborious the process of dressing
would be tomorrow morning if you had to figure out each
item, and how long it would take. Some habits are indis-
pensable; they save time and energy. Other habits are use-
less or even harmful. Observe anyone in a common setting,
such as the dinner table, and you will see that he does many
things habitually that have no real value in the process of
eating and are not even dictated by etiquette. Nearly every-
one has acquired little habits or mannerisms that serve no
useful purpose and may even be detrimental. The lecturer
fiddling with his glasses, the person who punctuates nearly
every remark with "You know what I mean," are examples
of such trivial habits-trivial, yes, but often distracting to
the listeners.
We are all familiar with the kind of habits usually labeled
"bad habits," such as drinking, addiction to drugs, etc.
These are serious and are usually very difficult to break.
There are also habits that greatly reduce the individual's
efficiency, although they are usually accepted by society
with no great disapproval. Let us list a few, and the reader
can add to the list. There are procrastination, gossiping,
wasting time, both one's own and that of others, eating be-
tween meals, going into debt, gambling, constant grouchi-
ness, inattention to personal appearance, and thousands
of others.
How does one go about getting rid of a habit? How can
one unlearn? Habits tend to disappear with disuse. The
difficulty comes in starting the disuse of a fixed habit.
Habitual action is pleasant, because it is easy; while breaking
a habit is difficult and therefore usually unpleasant. Habits

are forms of activity that occur when their stimulus is
present and, unless something is done about it, the habit
goes on and becomes more firmly fixed. One very useful rule
in breaking a habit is the formation of a counterhabit.
One must definitely wish to form the counterhabit-wish
to do so more strongly than he wishes to continue the
present habit. If the habit is grouchiness, it is not enough
merely to try to stop being grouchy, because that usually
results in emphasizing the condition. The first need is to
realize that one has this habit, and the second is to want to
stop it; finally, one must substitute some other positive habit
in its place. Most people hate to make a radical revolution
in their behavior. They become attached to their habitual
ways of doing things. The grouchy individual is even at-
tached to his grouchiness. If he wants to be a social success
and realizes that such a habit is detrimental to this, he is
well along the way to getting rid of the habit. Changes in
habits are unpleasant and, to be successful, require rather
strong motivation, real desire for change. However, the
change can be accomplished. Any habit can be broken.
In influencing others in any line of conduct, such as
training, selling, etc., habit must be taken into account.
The teacher trying to build up habits of good grammar
in children has to combat the grammatical habits acquired
already. As the child has for years been saying "It is me,'
the teacher has not only to teach him to say "It is I,” but
also to break down the wrong habit of years. The insurance
salesman in his task of selling insurance often encounters
long-established habits of thought that must be changed
before he can be successful in convincing the prospect of the
wisdom of the insurance plan. Anything outside the usual
routine of life tends to be sidetracked. Old ways are pleasant
and new ways are difficult. A routine medical examination,
seeing the dentist twice a year, starting a savings account,
or buying insurance are usually put off, for they are not
habitual activities. It often takes generations of intensive

work to get a nation thinking in new ways or acting differ-
ently. There is a habit inertia, which keeps us in the old
channels. Here, again, interest is the keynote. If interest
can be aroused, action will follow, even if it does not conform
to the habitual activity of years.
Habit inertia is very prominent in the thinking of people.
Our thinking goes along in much the same way from year
to year. Once we have been accustomed to one line of
thought, it is very difficult to start out on new voyages of
discovery. It is much easier to stay in the rut. New ways
are always difficult, not because they are any harder in
themselves but because they go against the current of habit-
ual thought. Yet progress in any line of endeavor requires
the blazing of new trails. It is easy to get into a rut and stay
there. This can be avoided by keeping the mind open to
new ideas and by being ready to try out new ways of doing
things. We may, through practice, acquire the habit of
forming new habits.
Social custom, fashion, or habit is changed very slowly.
It has been said that it takes three generations to change
a grammatical error, and it certainly required many, many
years to bring about changes in people's habits of sanitation.
The habits or customs of society help to determine the
habits of its members. We follow the crowd. Our whole
training is designed to keep us as we are. Because a håbit
has been the possession of mankind for centuries is no
guarantee that it is useful.
Learning is a vast topic to explore. In this chapter we have
done no more than introduce it. We may have succeeded in
showing that learning is involved in every phase of the
activities of the individual. Men are what they are because
they have learned to be that way. What has been learned
can be unlearned, or at least modified. Learning goes on
from birth to death. The individual is continually adjusting
to changing situations, and this adjustment leaves its effect.

THINKING AND
IMAGINATION
I. KINDS OF THINKING AND HOW THEY ARE DISTINGUISHED
T
HINKING, like perceiving and remembering, is a proc-
ess of knowing; but thinking depends on both perceiv-
ing and remembering for its material. The material of
thought, which is the product of previous observation, is
recalled through the process of remembering. However,
thinking can go beyond the barriers of natural phenomena
and can include objects and events that never happened and
probably never can happen. One can think of fairies, of
ghosts, of virtue, and of infinity, and other nonperceptual
objects. Nevertheless, these thoughts are the product of
actual observations. In general, thinking increases the scope
of observation and makes possible adjustments and activities
that would be impossible if thinking did not go beyond the
bounds of actual perceiving.
There are many kinds of thinking, such as reverie, con-
trolled association, reasoning, conceptual thinking, imagina-
tion, daydreams, night dreams, creative thought, and so on.
These various kinds of thinking are not separate and dis-
tinct, but grade into one another. All thinking makes use of
the same kind of material, so that it is not possible to dis-
tinguish types of thinking by the objects of thought. It is
possible, however, to make distinctions between different
thinking activities on the basis of the manner or method in
which the material of thought is employed. Thinking may
vary in at least two important ways: (1) in the kind and
amount of control of the process by the thinking individual,
and (2) in the degree of correspondence between the original
281

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
experience and the representation of that experience in
thought.
Let us take the first variable-degree of control-and try
to fit into it various examples of thinking along a scale of
degree or amount of control. Daydreaming, night dreaming,
reverie are examples of thinking that have a very small
amount of control. At the other extreme of this scale is the
highly controlled kind of thinking that is characteristic of
reasoning and creative invention. Between these extremes
are other varieties of thinking, which may be described in
terms of the kind and amount of control.
Night dreaming is a type of thinking that has a very small
amount of control by the individual. There is practically no
criticism or checkup of the process in terms of actual life
situations. The ordinary daytime standards of what is
probable or right or consistent are in abeyance, and the
thought shifts quickly from one scene to another without
any logical or rational sequence. Dreams while they last are
real. Images and recollections are accepted as having reality,
even though they may be extremely incongruous. Dreaming,
like all other activities, has a stimulus and is influenced by
the physiological condition of the individual.
A great deal of nonsense has been written and spoken
about dreams. Most dream interpretations are sheer imagina-
tion on the part of the interpreter. Dreams may be wish.
fulfilling in the sense that the dreamer achieves in his dreams
achievements that are denied him in actual living. Or, again,
dreams may be unpleasant. The child who has built up vivid
fear objects may dream constantly of these, and such dreams
may become so vivid as to be called nightmares. Freud and
the psychoanalysists make a great deal of dreams and have
gone to rather extreme lengths in making dreams symbolic
of motives, especially motives of a sexual nature. Dreams
can be considered as a form of thinking that is less subject
to conscious control than are other kinds of thinking.
Daydreaming is another type of thinking that has a small
282


## p. 283 (#299) ############################################

THINKING AND IMAGINATION
degree of control. Daydreams usually have a certain amount
of control in terms of a connected theme or story or “castle
in the air." The individual is usually the hero of his own
daydreams. He may
make himself the "conquering hero" or
the "suffering hero." Such forms of thinking are productive of
a certain amount of satisfaction to the dreamer, for in such
daydreams all kinds of desires are readily gratified in im-
agination. One form of daydreaming that does not seem to
offer this self-gratification is worry. Worry is a substitute for
real action when no real action is possible. Worry daydream-
ing may become a habit and a substitute for possible action.
We occasionally make a kind of game of worry and build up
in our daydreaming all kinds of possible calamities. Then,
when we discover that no such calamities have occurred,
there is a release of tension and a thrill of danger escaped.
Normal daydreaming is reserved for the time when no real
activity is possible. It is a passing amusement and is
promptly forgotten. The difficulty arises when the individual
substitutes daydreaming for actual striving. We will have
more to say about this in a later section.
Another kind of thinking is reverie, or free association.
This is thinking in which one thought calls up another and
the train of thought jumps from one thing to another without
any conscious control of the process by the individual him-
self. There must be some reason why one thought calls up
another in a reverie, and we find this in previous experiences
of the individual. Any one experience may call up any one of
a large number of other experiences, and we may summarize
the reasons why the particular sequence is followed in the
traditional "laws of association." These so-called laws are
frequency, recency, intensity or vividness, and emotional
congruity. The more frequently an experience has occurred
with another experience, the more liable is the one to call up
the other. The more recent an experience, the more liable
it is to be recalled. The more intense or vivid an experience
has been, the more likely it is to be revived in thought.
283


## p. 284 (#300) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
There is a further condition, which has been called emo-
tional congruity. The mood or the emotion present at the
time has an influence on the train of free associations.
Most thinking is not so loose and uncontrolled as the kinds
already mentioned. There is usually some controlling factor
present. The mental set or preparation of the individual
controls his process of thought. To take a very simple exam-
ple, the figures 2 and 7 may produce any one of a number of
responses. The individual may think of them as 27 or 9 or 5,
etc., depending upon whether he has had the reading set, the
adding set, or the subtracting set, or some other. The same
thing is true in reading; the context of the word determines
what particular meaning is given to it. Another form of con-
trol is the objective situation. For instance, words and events
in church arouse a different train of thought from that re-
called by the same words in other situations.
A problem produces a set that directs the thinking toward
a solution. A difficult problem requires considerable search
for the solution, and the result may be the kind of thinking
that is called reasoning, or the type of thought called creative
or inventive. We will consider these two kinds of thinking
in more detail in a later section.
The other distinguishing variable is the degree to which a
thought is a faithful reproduction of past experiences, or the
amount of correspondence between the thought and the
actual experience. As with the other variable, we can find
types of thought that vary between two extremes. Thought
may be extremely faithful in reproducing past experiences.
Recollections or memories of past events may be almost
perfect reproductions, but usually errors and omissions.
creep in. In recalling names and telephone numbers, dates,
prices, and so on, the memory may be the exact duplicate of
the actual fact. This type of thinking is the one extreme in
terms of this variable. There is the other extreme, as well,
which is usually called imaginative recall. In imagination
the arrangement of details is very different from actual fact.
284


## p. 285 (#301) ############################################

THINKING AND IMAGINATION
True, the materials of the imagination are the recalled facts
of previous experience, but the spatial and temporal arrange-
ment differs widely from actual experience. Perhaps the most
interesting types of thinking are reasoning and imagination,
so we will discuss these in further detail.
2. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROCESS OF REASONING
Reasoning is a form of thinking that occurs when the
individual is faced with a problem that demands a solution
or requires an adjustment. A problem is a situation for which
the individual has no ready-made response. In such situations
a person may do a number of things: he may deny that it is
a problem and do nothing; he may not recognize the situation
as being problematic, and again do nothing; or he may recog-
nize the problem and go to work trying one thing after
another until he has hit on a solution; or finally, he may
reason out a solution. Animals also are faced occasionally
with problems, and their behavior in such situations is
usually such that it can be called trial and error. They
try one thing after another until, finally, if they persist long
enough, they will be successful in finding a solution. This
kind of adjustment is far from being efficient or economical.
The human individual at times uses this kind of adjustment
to problematic situations. A person who is trying to solve a
mechanical puzzle tries first this way, then that way, and,
after a long period of manipulation, he finally solves the
puzzle. This is not characteristic of human adjustment.
Usually, the trial and error is not so overt or open, but is
rather a process of thinking or reasoning.
Reasoning is very like trial-and-error behavior; but,
instead of motor exploration, it is mental exploration. It
is thus time and effort saving. Reasoning is, therefore, a
highly purposeful, controlled, selective thinking process,
the material of which is predominantly factual reproductions
of past experience. Reasoning and learning are closely related,
285


## p. 286 (#302) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
both being methods of solving problems, learning usually
resulting from the process of reasoning.
The first essential in reasoning is the presence of a problem.
Now the problem may be any one of a number of kinds.
It may be a practical problem, such as finding one's way
about in a strange city, or the method of constructing a boat,
or how to find a lost collar button. In such situations, we
explore the situation in thought and by observation. We
observe facts in the situation, we recall previously learned
rules or principles and experiences with similar situations.
Some of these we discard as being of no value in the present
occasion; others we try out and find to be useless; some we
follow through further in thought and discover them not
to be applicable; and, finally, we find a real clue and the
problem is solved. The directive or controlling influence in
the process is the problem.
Another kind of problem that is productive of reasoning
is the desire to justify one's actions. This process is usually
called rationalization. I have work to do, but there is a
football game that I want to see. It is an easy matter to
find reasons why it would be better to attend the game. I
am stale, tired, in need of recreation and fresh air; or it is
my duty to support the team of my alma mater. This form
of reasoning or rationalization was discussed in Chap. V.
From an early age man asks "Why?" of many of the
things that he observes. This is often the starting point of a
reasoning process. Why do the wheels go round? Observa-
tion and recall of previously learned principles, when put
together, give the answer.
The reasoning process may take its start from a general
principle or rule and seek applications. We read a book
or listen to a lecture in which a general principle is given.
We wish to see how this applies, and so we search our
memories for examples of such a principle in action. Such a
process is a real aid in understanding the principle and also
in remembering it.
286


## p. 287 (#303) ############################################

THINKING AND IMAGINATION
Related to this last type of problem-motivating reasoning
is the presence of doubt. Doubt may stimulate a person to
reason out ways in which a statement may not be true.
Someone makes a general statement that you doubt, and
immediately you search through your memory for instances.
in which the general proposition does not fit.
Another starting point for reasoning is the desire to verify.
Theories in science are the starting points for further search.
Darwin stated an hypothesis concerning the mechanism of
evolution, and that has served as the starting point for
numerous investigations and reasoning processes to verify
this theory. Sometimes such theories are refuted in this way
and sometimes they are verified. Whatever the result,
the theories are valuable in motivating people to further
search and thinking along that line.
We have mentioned some of the kinds of problems that
motivate reasoning. Now, we need to outline some further
characteristics of the reasoning process. When the individual
has a problem, he recalls from his past experience facts
bearing on this problem and also makes further observations
of the present situation. These are the materials of the
reasoner. With these he works, rejecting some as not per-
tinent, combining others in new ways so that new infor-
mation comes to light. The final result of reasoning is an
inference. Recall is essential to reasoning, but reasoning is
more than recall; it is the discovery of new facts in those
recalled and observed. The world places a heavy premium
on such discoveries. The inference or discovery is the solution
of the problem that was the starting point of the process.
As this process of reasoning is almost a daily occurrence and
of real practical importance, it may be worth while to attempt
to list those features which go to make a good reasoner.
3. CHARACTERISTICS OF A GOOD REASONER
From the above discussion we may now deduce some
of the more important characteristics of the good reasoner.
287


## p. 288 (#304) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
(a) There is the obvious need for facts. If the reasoner is to
be successful and the reasoning to be useful, it is necessary
that the reasoner have a wide selection of, facts to utilize.
This implies a wide experience and a facile memory of past
experiences. (b) The good reasoner needs to perceive accu-
rately what the problem is and needs to keep this problem
clearly in mind. The problem serves as a selective agency,
determining what facts shall be recalled and what dis-
carded. The problem helps the reasoner to observe pertinent
facts in the present situation and to utilize them in the final
outcome. (c) The good reasoner analyzes the details system-
atically and not in a haphazard fashion. He attends to per-
tinent details and attempts to fit them into the complete
picture. The details are always handled in a systematic
way, so that there is a minimum of fumbling or trial and
error. (d) The good reasoner avoids inflexibility. He is versatile
and does not keep to a single track if that does not lead to a
solution. He keeps wide awake to a wide range of possi-
bilities and is open-minded, so that he is not blind to possible
avenues of solution. In the solution of a mechanical puzzle,
one subject was observed to keep the same unfruitful line
of attack for over 10 hours; and, even after he had been
shown the correct solution, he went on for over an hour
before finally switching from his chosen line of attack to
the other. (e) The other extreme is also avoided by the good
reasoner; that is, the tendency to go off at tangents and not
stick to one line of attack long enough really to discover
whether it would be successful or not. (f) The study of
methods of thought as used by others is another aid to the
successful reasoner. (g) The habit of generalization is, again,
an aid to efficient reasoning. This habit of finding in any solu-
tion a general principle that may be applied to a wide range
of problems may, like all habits, be acquired with practice.
Modern life requires straight thinking, yet straight think-
ing is very scarce in our day. Very few have acquired the
ability of judging, weighing, evaluating, and drawing con-
288


## p. 289 (#305) ############################################

THINKING AND IMAGINATION
clusions for themselves. Nearly everyone is prone to accept
uncritically the opinion of the editor of his daily newspaper
or to adopt without thought the propaganda about politics,
economics, or international relations. If, when wars threat-
ened, there were a majority of straight thinkers, there
would be no wars. Unfortunately, the majority of people
do not reason for themselves in such a crisis but accept
blindly and uncritically what they hear and read. The mind
of the man in the street is a museum of immature fixations,
snap judgments, picked-up prejudices, and unverified hand-
medowns of opinion; and yet this same man judges the
affairs of the nation, hires the minister, selects governments,
and composes them. A careful study of the principles
involved in good reasoning and a persistent attempt to
put these principles into daily practice would greatly aid
us all.
4. THE NATURE OF IMAGINATION
Imagination carries us beyond the realm of personal
experience. It is true that the materials of imagination,
like all other kinds of thinking, are recalled experiences;
but the distinguishing characteristic of imagination consists
in the new combinations into which these recalled facts are
placed. There is no sharp line between imagination and
memory. As we have noted in another connection, in the
recall of a past event or experience there are usually ele-
ments that do not conform to the original event. A young
child makes no very distinct differentiation between past
experiences or memories and imaginations. He often gives
the product of his imagination as the truth and sometimes
is punished for it. The imagination of the child is often so
vivid and real that, unless there is definite teaching or
guidance, he will be unable to tell the difference between the
products of his imagination and the products of his senses.
All imagination depends on personal experience. The ele-
ments of all imagination must be from actual experience.
289


## p. 290 (#306) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
This is rather important, because it emphasizes the need for
facts and experiences in such a factless thing as imagination.
The thinker without facts is like the carpenter without tools.
The most productive thinkers are not those who disregard
the knowledge, methods, and trials of others but those who
are familiar with them. Originality, or creative thinking,
is not opposed to the amassing of facts or to the ordinary
laws of learning, but is rather dependent on them.
5. CREATIVE OR INVENTIVE IMAGINATION.
New combinations of ideas in imagination are essential
to the progress of the human race. The highest achieve-
ments of man are the result of the development of new
combinations of ideas to fit new situations. Invention, or
creative thinking, is the process of recombining facts, ideas,
and observations in such a way that the result is something
that transcends old knowledge; but inventions and creative
thinking have to build on old foundations. There is nothing
new under the sun except new combinations.
Problems give rise to new ways of thought. Dissatisfaction
with present ways of doing things and thinking about things
leads to the production of new ideas and new inventions.
The perfectly adjusted individual who is completely satis-
fied with his present activity and ways of thought is not
motivated to learn anything new or to reason out new
inferences or to create new ways of doing or thinking. The
individual who finds a problem in everything and is thus
motivated to learn something different or to reason out some
new method or to imagine some novel invention is con-
tributing to human progress. The starting point for creative
imagination is similar to that for reasoning and learning—a
recognized problem.
Imagination is aided by the accumulation of a large
body of organized knowledge. Creative imagination is not
an inborn characteristic. Rather, it is a habit that can be
acquired. New ways of thinking may be learned from others.

## p. 292 (#308) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
There are people who make a habit of mulling over their
ideas and getting them into new relations and combinations.
When this habit has been acquired, original thinking comes
to be as natural as original thinking ever is. When one of
these individuals reads a book, he does not stop there,
but recalls ideas that he has received from other sources.
Comparing the ideas of one author with another, he evaluates
what he reads in the light of his own experience and attempts
to apply this knowledge to new situations. All this tends
toward the production of new combinations of ideas. Creative
thinking is comparatively rare, because most people are
willing to accept things as they are or as people say they are.
Originality or newness does not guarantee the truth or
value of thought. The ravings of an insane patient in a
mental hospital, while they may be original enough, may
also be utterly valueless. So the new and the original must
be put to the same tests as the old and the traditional,
the tests of usefulness. One very important essential in
creative imagination is, then, criticism or checkup with
actual situations. The test is, Does it work? When old ways
of thought become inadequate, imagination offers new ways,
some of which may fill our needs and some of which may be
valueless. Without imagination we should be forced to go
on in the same way as our ancestors before us; but, unless
there is evaluation of the various products of the imagination
and a selection from them of those corresponding to actual
needs and facts, imagination would lead to disaster about
as often as to advantage.
6. VALUES AND DANGERS OF IMAGINATION
We are ready now to summarize some of the advantages
and disadvantages of the imaginative process. Let us look
at some of the uses or values of imagination, first. The
future is never the same as the past or the present. Man
has been able to advance in civilization because of his ability
to look into the future and provide for it. Planning or
292


## p. 293 (#309) ############################################

THINKING AND IMAGINATION
building in the imagination a picture of possible events and
preparing for them is not only an advantage but a necessity.
This is one important use of imagination. Discoveries and
inventions, also, are the result of the process of imagination.
Another sphere of life in which imagination plays a large
part is art. It requires imagination both to create art and to
enjoy it. The more one can "feel himself into" a picture, a
drama, or the plot of a novel, the more he enjoys it.
Imagination must not take the place of real action
habitually. The product of imagination should be action.
Active adjustment is not always possible and in such cases
we usually substitute imaginary action. The child at play
would be a warrior and kill his foes, but perhaps for lack of
foes or the tools for murder, and also because of social habits
that are against killing, he lacks the opportunity of carrying
out that impulse. By means of make-believe, however, he
is able to be as bloody a warrior as he wishes in his own
imagination. The same is true of many who desire great
wealth or something else that is impossible of achievement.
In such a case, there is a general tendency to engage in day-
dreaming and achieve one's successes in that way. Day-
dreaming is usually a rather worthless, if not harmful, affair,
because it takes the place of real action and striving to
achieve actual goals.
Not all daydreaming is equally useless. For instance, a
boy wishes to be a great doctor, but he cannot become a
doctor of any kind without a
kind without a long period of preparation.
He can, however, and usually does, engage in daydreams
about the day when he will actually perform a difficult
operation and save a life. This daydreaming may be valuable
in keeping the goal before him during the long and tedious
course of study; thus his purpose will be kept strong until he
actually achieves his dream. In all exercise of imagination
the thinker must not lose touch with reality. What is
imagined must be based on actual facts and centered around
a definite problem. There are unfortunate instances where
293


## p. 294 (#310) ############################################

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
the imagination gets disconnected with reality. Daydreams
may be an easy way out of the difficulties of life and, if
they become too satisfying, they may become dangerous.
The daydreams in which we see ourselves reaching some
goal may be very useful in keeping our faces set toward
that goal and in helping us plan for its achievement; but
it is necessary to realize continually that they are only
dreams and that hard work alone can turn them into actual
experience. Imagination may be either a genuine handicap
or a real aid.
7. SOME COMMON CAUSES OF
'CROOKED" THINKING
Straight thinking is not only important; it is essential
for effective democratic living. Nevertheless, a careful exami-
nation of our own thinking or that of other people will
show many examples of crooked thinking. Such thinking
can be avoided if we know the common sources of error,
and some of its causes can be stated simply.
There is, first, the presence of prejudice. Prejudice is pre-
judging—that is, making up one's mind in advance. Wher-
ever there is prejudice there is cloudy thinking. All people
have prejudices, but the important thing is to recognize
this fact and to recognize the prejudices that we possess
so that we can guard against their effect on our thinking.
The tendency is for the individual to allow his beliefs and
prejudices to color and direct the course of his thinking.
For instance, when a man thinks that woman's place is in
the home, he is liable to see no good or value in the work of
women out of the home, even though there may be plenty
of evidence of such value right before his eyes. Straight
thinking is impossible when prejudices are present; so,
beware of prejudice.
Another cause of crooked thinking is the wish to believe.
This is very similar to prejudice. The individual decides
what he would like to believe and what it would be to his
advantage to believe, and then all his thinking is warped

THINKING AND IMAGINATION
to bring about that result. In this regard, it is a good practice
to be
wary of any conclusion or belief that gives you too
much satisfaction and comfort. Thinking is the manipula-
tion of ideas and facts in order to arrive at some conclusion.
When the person has a strong desire to arrive at a particular
conclusion, this desire tends to act as a selection agent and
only evidence that leads toward that conclusion is brought to
mind.
Related to the above two causes of crooked thinking is
what we will call emotional involvement. This means the
presence of some emotion, such as fear, or some sentiment,
such as patriotism. When emotions get mixed with thinking,
the thinking suffers, as the emotional condition reduces the
intellectual or rational element. When he is afraid, the
individual is incapable of very accurate thinking; when he
is angry, his thinking is liable to be biased and crooked.
Whenever strong sentiments enter the picture, an individual
is unable to reach logical conclusions.
Suggestion can be a powerful agency in misdirecting the
thinking process. When anyone is suggestible, he is ready
to accept uncritically and without evaluation whatever he
hears or reads from the source to which he is suggestible.
For instance, some are suggestible to their favorite news-
paper; others may be suggestible to any printed page, so
that they are ready to accept anything that they read.
Another person may be suggestible in terms of the spoken
word when it comes from a particular source-perhaps
ready to accept anything that is said from a public platform.
Most of us are suggestible to some particular person or type
of person. In order to think clearly, an individual needs to
beware of the process of suggestion.
Inaccurate or indefinite use of words may be the source
of crooked thinking. Words are vehicles of thoughts and
ideas, but words may be used to cloud thought and obscure
ideas. This sometimes happens when someone starts by
using a word in a special sense and later gives the same
295

PRACTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
word a slightly different meaning. Or one may become
confused in his thinking by the use of technical terminology
that he only partly understands; thus he confuses both him-
self and his listeners with words that do not convey any
precise meaning. Beware of thinking that gets lost in words
that have not a clear meaning.
Most crooked thinking is the result of distortion that
results from the selection of data or facts. It has been said
that anything can be proved by statistics. This is true when the
selection of the statistics to be quoted is such that only a part
of the total picture is given. And what is true of statistics is
true of other kinds of data, as well. Thinking can be effective
only when the materials of thought are adequate. Peculiar
and distorted conclusions result when the thinker uses inade-
quate and incomplete data.
8. SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THINKING
a. Training and practice in thinking can best be obtained
in fields where there is no prejudice or emotional involvement.
b. The habit of critical analysis is a useful asset. Be
just as critical of your own conclusions and the method of
arriving at them as you are of the opinions and conclusions of
others. Beware of the process of suggestion, and learn to
weigh and evaluate evidence.
ċ. Beware of the desire to believe. Be ready to scrutinize
your conclusions carefully when those conclusions give you
too much comfort.
d. Make use of all available checks on the accuracy of
thinking, such as syllogisms, graphic representations, etc.
e. Develop the habits of asking questions, keen observa-
tion, active relating, verification of information, persistence,
and accuracy. These habits aid in straight thinking.
f. Let someone else examine your conclusions and the
evidence on which the conclusions are based. If
you cannot
get agreement from an intelligent, unbiased person, then
your conclusion is probably incorrect.

GLOSSARY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TERMS
The beginner in any science has the difficulty of understanding
the technical terms employed. This difficulty is even more acute
in psychology, because a number of terms that have a popular,
or everyday, meaning have been adopted by psychologists and
given restricted, technical significance. In most cases, the meaning
of terms is made clear by their context, and in this book the
language has been kept as free as possible of obscure words. How-
ever, a list of the more common psychological terms will doubtless
be found useful to the beginner. Some words not used in the present
text are included because it is assumed that the reader will en-
counter them in other psychological literature. This glossary
cannot be made complete as that would require a whole book in
itself. For a more complete dictionary of psychological terms the
reader is referred to A Student's Dictionary of Psychological Terms,
by H. B. English.

manner.
abnormal-Deviating from the normal or average. In actual
practice the word is reserved for extreme variations.
